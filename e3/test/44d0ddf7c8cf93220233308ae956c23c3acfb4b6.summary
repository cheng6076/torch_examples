' " the behavior carried on for a number of months and on several occasions , the post states . eventually the cafe 's manager made it clear to @entity2 that his actions were unwelcome . @entity2 , who regularly visits the @entity8 cafe with his wife , told reporters that his behavior was in the context of " a bit of banter , " but said that he had apologized when it was clear she had taken offense . the blog post says that the prime minister offered the offended waitress two bottles of his own @entity75 @entity74 wine by way of apology . " we have lots of fun and games there , there 's always lots of practical jokes and things . it 's a very warm and friendly relationship , " he told reporters in @entity87 en route to @entity90 day commemorations in @entity91 , @entity92 . " but if you look at it now , no. when i realized she took offense by that i just sort of immediately went back , gave her some wine , apologized and said i was terribly sorry . " politicians and public figures also rounded on @entity2 , with @entity103 mp @entity102 saying that the prime minister should be held to the same standards of behavior as the rest of the electorate . " a lot of @entity3 know what it 's like to feel as if you 're not taken seriously in a job . as politicians , our job is to make people feel safe at work , not bullied , " @entity3 media reported her as saying . " it 's a sign of how out of touch @entity2 has become when he ca n't even monitor how inappropriate his personal behavior is , and when people are not comfortable with how he is behaving . " @entity122 , head of the @entity123 , echoed the sentiment . " it 's never ok to touch someone without their permission , " @entity9 reported her as saying . " there are no exceptions .
