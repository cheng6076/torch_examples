( @entity0 ) you may know @entity2 from @entity4 's cult hit comedy " the @entity5 , " in which she plays @entity5 , a perky , quirky @entity6 juggling her career and love life in @entity9 . ( only in the @entity11 can a doctor not afford an apartment ! ) the show was a breakthrough for on - screen representation — the first network sitcom created by and starring a woman of color — and it looks likely to be renewed for the coming 2015 - 16 season . recently , however , @entity2 's brother @entity21 unveiled a project of his own , and while it has been getting a lot of attention , it has n't generated quite as many laughs — either from observers or from his famous sibling , who told him it brought " shame upon their family .

( only in the @entity11 can a doctor not afford an apartment ! ) the show was a breakthrough for on - screen representation — the first network sitcom created by and starring a woman of color — and it looks likely to be renewed for the coming 2015 - 16 season*****0
recently , however , @entity2 's brother @entity21 unveiled a project of his own , and while it has been getting a lot of attention , it has n't generated quite as many laughs — either from observers or from his famous sibling , who told him it brought " shame upon their family*****1
" you see , @entity21 revealed that , as an undergraduate at the @entity35 , he engaged in a daring ( his view ) or ridiculous and offensive ( pretty much everyone else ) scam : he applied to medical school claiming to be african - american*****1
@entity21 had spent his college years as a " hard - partying frat boy , " and achieved a less than stunning 3.1 gpa*****0
upon facing graduation and exploring his med school options , he realized that fellow @entity47 with his grades were getting turned down from the universities of his choice — but that " black , @entity53 , and @entity52 applicants with my grades and test scores were much more likely to gain acceptance*****1
" this revelation led him to make the decision to pose as a black man , both to " dramatically improve " his chances of admission , and to illustrate the unfair advantage that blacks and other underrepresented minorities receive when applying to prestigious schools*****1
to accomplish this goal , @entity21 shaved his head of its naturally wavy black locks , trimmed his " long @entity73 - @entity72 eyelashes , " checked " black " under the optional race / ethnicity declaration and submitted his application to 14 schools under his childhood nickname " @entity77*****1
" he received invitations for in - person interviews at 11 schools , results that he claims support the notion that african - americans garner special privileges that are unavailable to whites or @entity86*****0
and now that the statute of limitations on his act of fraud has expired , he 's looking to write a book on his experiences , titled " @entity93 : the @entity94 of an @entity73 @entity72 who got into @entity96 to be an @entity97*****0
" what 's truly curious is that even if you agree with @entity21 that affirmative action is merely a form of " systematic racism , " when all is said and done , it offers very little evidence of the " privilege " that he claims is accorded to black , @entity53 and @entity52 candidates*****1
@entity21 had mediocre grades and @entity109 , but he graduated from one of the most prestigious schools in the nation*****0
yet even while representing himself as black , @entity21 received only a single admission offer , to @entity116 's @entity115 , which falls somewhere between 57th and 67th in national rankings*****1
@entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and all the higher ranked schools he applied to rejected him*****0
meanwhile , he admits , pretending to be black came with disadvantages*****1
he found himself being accused of shoplifting by store clerks and harassed by cops — who would regularly stop him while driving and demand that he tell them how much his car cost , implying that he must have stolen it*****0
these acts of very real prejudice , experienced regularly by blacks and @entity133 of all backgrounds — multimillionaire comedian @entity135 has recently been tweeting pictures of the occasions when he is pulled over by police for no reason — did n't seem to dissuade @entity21 from his adamant belief in the unfairness of a system that seeks to address the shockingly low numbers of minority health practitioners by providing some weight to race and ethnicity in decision - making*****0
it 's not just a matter of what individual applicants " deserve*****0
" one - third of @entity72 are black , @entity53 or @entity52 ; just one in 10 physicians are*****0
since minority medical practitioners are up to three times as likely to practice in their own communities , this lack of diversity has produced " doctor deserts , " in which urban and rural ethnic enclaves across the nation go without access to primary care physicians*****0
years ago , when i told my father — a doctor from a long line of doctors — that i did n't want to follow in his footsteps , he told me that was fine , because medicine is a service trade , and anyone not interested in serving should avoid the profession*****0
a medical degree is n't a reward to be earned , he said , but a responsibility to be accepted*****0
which really cuts to the heart of what 's so sad about @entity21 's racial farce*****1
like others who 've recently been exposed for falsely claiming racial identities — including putative presidential candidate @entity183 , who registered himself as " @entity53 " on a 2009 voter form , and @entity186 sen. @entity185 , who was excoriated during her campaign for having claimed @entity52 ancestry in the past — @entity21 wanted to claim the fruits of racial affiliation without having to carry black people 's burden*****1
race is n't just about color or blood ; it is about the collective experiences and inherited cultural context and present - day condition of a community of people*****0
many of the markers of race are persistently corrosive ; others are deeply painful*****0
affirmative action programs are a means of redress for these awful realities of our nation 's history ; an imperfect one , but necessary*****0
there are some fields where the imbalances might never correct themselves on their own*****0
industries like health care and @entity221*****0
because what 's most ironic about @entity21 's decision to ride on his sister 's coattails in telling his story : while @entity86 are well represented in medicine , our numbers are vanishingly low in the entertainment and media world , and until the recent breakthrough of modern pioneers like @entity2 , it was impossible to imagine film and television that included our faces , voices and stories*****1
@entity2 's immense talent and charisma made her a star*****1
but it was a quota - based affirmative action initiative -- @entity245 's @entity244 -- that gave her a start .*****0
