( @entity1 ) sen. @entity0 insists she 's not running for president . but her description of a 2016 " dream " presidential candidate sounds a lot like , well , her . @entity9 , during an appearance friday on @entity1 's " @entity8 , " said she wanted to see someone willing to fight for the middle class and " make @entity13 work for families again . " @entity9 says she feels that @entity13 functions well for special interest groups and the well - connected but leaves out the rest of the nation . " ( i 've ) spent my whole life studying what 's happening to @entity22 's middle class and watching year by year , one blow after another , " she said . " we live in an @entity22 now where the game is rigged , where @entity13 works really great for those who hire armies of lobbyists , armies of lawyers . it 's just not working so well for the rest of @entity22 . " @entity9 , a @entity35 @entity34 , also got specific with her wish list , mentioning that a candidate willing to lower the interest rates on student loans and shore up @entity40 would get high marks from her . what the economy means for 2016 she would n't say which of the slew of declared or yet - to - declare candidates fit that bill , but she did want to give all of them a chance as the 2016 campaign kicks off . " i really want to give everybody who gets in this race a chance to get out there and put their agenda in front of us , " she said . however , @entity9 said the two @entity61 candidates who have gotten into the race -- @entity64 sen. @entity63 and @entity66 sen. @entity65 -- have already disqualified themselves in her eyes because of how they 've voted in @entity70 . " i 've watched them vote , " @entity9 said . " they voted against the @entity40 benefits increase . they voted against reducing the interest rate on student loans . " opinion : can @entity78 really take on @entity79 ? @entity9 , a former special adviser for the @entity80 , is something of a political rock star in the eyes of many liberal and progressive voters because of her populist leanings and her passionate calls for an end to income inequality . many of them want her to get into the race and become a viable challenger to @entity78 frontrunner @entity93 . when asked , yet again , if she was going to run , @entity9 did n't exactly say no. " i want to see who else gets in this race , " she said . " and i want to see what the issues are that they push . "
