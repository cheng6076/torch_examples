( @entity1 ) @entity0 has come up with a devil of an idea to market its lingerie while poking fun at a competitor . the plus - size clothing retailer has launched an ad campaign for its @entity0 line titled # @entity10 , seeking to " redefine sexy . " in a commercial posted on @entity12 , a group of plus - size models show off the bras and panties while saying things like " how boring would it be if we were all the same ? " and " it 's all about how you feel . " the campaign is a not - so - subtle dig at @entity23 and its very popular @entity25 line , which caters to smaller women . the lingerie giant was criticized last year for a campaign featuring the words " @entity30 " over images of slender supermodels , and @entity33 reports that it is under increasing pressure from consumers to offer larger sizes . @entity0 's campaign is getting positive buzz in social media land , with the company being hailed for celebrating beauty of all shapes and sizes . " our ' @entity46 ' campaign is designed to empower all women to love every part of herself , " chief executive officer @entity43 said in a statement . " @entity0 firmly believes that she is sexy and we want to encourage her to confidently show it , in her own way . " the ads will be featured in the company 's stores , on television , in print and on billboards , as well as featured on the brand 's social media accounts .
