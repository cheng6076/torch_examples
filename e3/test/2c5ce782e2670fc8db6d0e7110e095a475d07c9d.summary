@entity17 physicist @entity16 is working on yet another impressive addition to that list : using focused laser beams to affect the weather*****1
it sounds like black magic , but it 's actually a cleaner version of cloud seeding , a form of weather modification that has been used for several years -- most famously by @entity27 in preparation for the @entity29 , when they launched rockets to seed the clouds and prevent rainfall during the opening ceremony*****0
but it 's hard to tell how effective cloud seeding actually is , and it involves the spraying of chemicals into the atmosphere , something which it surely does n't need*****0
laser is therefore a completely clean alternative to traditional cloud seeding : it 's light , and nothing but light*****0
how does laser actually affect the weather ? just like cloud seeding , it can create new clouds where there are none , by inducing condensation : naturally occurring water vapor is condensed into droplets , and ice crystals form , mimicking the natural process that creates clouds*****1
that way , rainfall can be triggered to " empty " the atmosphere and increase the potential of dry weather later on : " we did it on a laboratory scale , we can already create clouds , but not on a macroscopic scale , so you do n't see a big cloud coming out because the laser is not powerful enough and because of a lot of technical parameters that we ca n't yet control , " professor @entity16 told @entity0 's @entity60*****1
that is not to say that the laser he 's tested is n't powerful : at one terawatt , it has the same energy produced by all the nuclear power plants on @entity78 : " of course , it does n't last very long , " @entity16 said*****0
the technology is still in its infancy then , but once it 's perfected , it could help us modulate the weather in areas of high contrast , such as @entity84 or @entity85 , where flooding and droughts occur in extreme vicinity*****0
through lasers , those effects could be smoothed to have less rain in flooding - prone areas and more rain in drought - prone areas : " you can transport the water to a different location , " @entity16 said*****1
