" first thing in the morning , we water them , and give them some treats and feed them some hay , " @entity124 said . each elephant eats about 150 pounds of food a day . twenty - one tons of hay usually lasts only 10 days at the center . exercise is also part of the daily routine , including stretching . " we just do that a few times on each leg with them , just to give them a good stretch , " @entity124 said . " we do some footwork with them . all of our elephants , generally once a month , get a pedicure , just to make sure their feet are in good condition . " all of this care is n't cheap . " each elephant costs over $ 65,000 a year , per year , over all the years of their life , " @entity30 said . " we 're fortunate we 're for profit . we do make a profit and we 're a privately owned family business , and so we 've made a decision we want to devote a lot of resources here . " it 's a price @entity30 said he 's willing to pay to keep this species -- some varieties of which in @entity111 and @entity174 are endangered -- alive for generations to come . " i always say , it 's sort of like @entity178 with a happy ending , " @entity30 said .
