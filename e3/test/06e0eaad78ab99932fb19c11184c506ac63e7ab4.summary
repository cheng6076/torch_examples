( @entity0 ) job one for newly appointed attorney general @entity1 is to create a muscular federal response to months of national unrest over controversial police killings like that of @entity6 , 25*****0
@entity6 's death last week -- from a spinal cord injury he suffered while in police custody -- has touched off days of protests and rioting in @entity12*****0
@entity1 's job wo n't be easy : as the nation 's top law enforcement officer , she takes the reins of a @entity17 that has been walking a fine line between nudging local police departments in the direction of better community relations , and threatening legal action against departments where discrimination or brutality are out of control*****1
but as events in @entity12 demonstrate , too many local departments are n't getting the message*****1
@entity1 will need to put down the carrots , pick up the stick and make clear that the @entity17 intends to crack down on police abuse by using one of its most potent weapons : the power to withhold federal funds from local departments*****1
more about that in a moment*****0
the first order of business will be to re-establish order in @entity12 , where the @entity45 has been mobilized and a state of emergency declared*****0

@entity1 has already launched a probe of the death of @entity6 , and the @entity17 is also investigating the recent videotaped police killing of @entity109 in @entity110 , @entity111 , where an officer has been arrested and charged with murder*****0
as attorney general , @entity1 has several tools with which to guide local law enforcement toward better behavior*****1
a justice department program called @entity119 , launched in 2011 , helps local departments implement best practices*****1
the @entity119 program 's effectiveness will surely come under question , since @entity12 was one of the eight departments participating in the voluntary program*****1
@entity1 can also apply the tougher approach of suing local departments and securing court - ordered reforms , a power conferred by the @entity132*****1
the provision was a result of the 1991 videotaped police beating of @entity136 by @entity138 cops and the riot that ensued when the officers were acquitted*****0
the @entity142 administration has sued local departments 15 times -- more than either the @entity145 or @entity146 administrations -- and has opened 11 more investigations of departments including those in @entity150 , @entity151 , and @entity152 , @entity153*****1
