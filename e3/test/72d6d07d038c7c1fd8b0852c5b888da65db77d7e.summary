@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) the little - known star of this week 's no. 1 car chase movie , " @entity5 " is n't a car . it 's an airplane . film producers hired a @entity10 c - 130 hercules to fly five cars 12,000 feet high , open a cargo door at the rear of the plane and parachute them out in a spectacular free - fall stunt . @entity17 ! happy 60th birthday to the @entity19 -- the oldest continuously produced family of military planes in history . @entity10 has been making these airplanes longer than the legendary b - 52 bomber and the famous @entity26 spy jet . unlike those planes , the @entity27 has never become a household name . the fact that " @entity32 " producers chose a plane that was designed in the 1950s tells you a little something about the success of the @entity19 . the film makes it appear as if another plane -- a @entity38 -- drops the cars . but in real life , it took a @entity19 to pull it off . shooting the scene posed unique logistical challenges , said stunt coordinator @entity44 in a featurette video about the mission . " you start throwing all those cars out together -- you 've got to figure out spacing . and these things drop very fast , " @entity49 said . @entity51 of @entity52 co-piloted the stunt . " we have to be very precise in our headings and our altitudes , " he says in the video . the @entity19 is big . it 's tough . it 's versatile . it refuels helicopters in flight . it can fly a small military force and its heavy equipment around the world -- and land on short , unfinished airstrips . at @entity10 's @entity0 , @entity1 , factory in 1955 , the governor of @entity1 christened the first production @entity69 by smashing a bottle of @entity72 water across its nose . the plane then proceeded to take off from nearby @entity75 . on tuesday , exactly 60 years later , @entity1 gov. @entity76 recreated the ceremony -- christening a brand new @entity19 during a birthday party of sorts for @entity10 executives and military dignitaries . " i 'm told that the 2,500th version of this aircraft is now on the ( assembly ) line inside this building , " @entity76 said . " it transports , it becomes a war airplane as necessary and it is recognized as the true workhorse .

" @entity99 dropping a car out of an airplane is easy . whatever we can fit inside the ( cargo ) hold , we can drop . " several factors come into play for a pilot making a drop , @entity91 said , including payload weight , wind speed and timing . " we have to give time for the car to clear the airplane , let the parachutes deploy , and then actually open , " he said . one tricky decision involves how high the plane drops its cargo . " there 's a trade off -- between dropping it low and being more accurate ... and dropping it high where you have a little more safety in how it will land . " @entity91 also explained how the @entity27 's robust landing gear helps the plane survive difficult landing conditions . " the pilot gets to decide how hard the touchdown 's going to be , " he said . " sometimes to get his performance , he needs to really let it crunch on the ground . but the airplane can handle it . " meanwhile , in the back of the plane , @entity10 loadmaster @entity135 showed off the plane 's new reversible deck , which makes it easier to switch the floor from a flat surface ... to a floor with rollers embedded in it . the rollers make it easier to move cargo around and launch it out the back of the airplane . the legacy surrounding the @entity19 has been built by 60 years of successful missions , including : in 1989 , a flight crew aboard a @entity19 named @entity154 was credited with saving the crew of a @entity157 hurricane hunter airplane . while flying through @entity159 , the @entity157 plane lost an engine and suffered damage to a second engine . @entity163 57 happened to be nearby and located a safe place for the @entity157 plane to escape the eye of the deadly category 5 storm . everyone returned safely to base . in 2012 , @entity170 brig . gen. @entity171 revealed how he flew a @entity19 on a successful hostage rescue mission to @entity173 , @entity174 . four c - 130s helped rescue passengers from a hijacked @entity178 flight in 1976 . " at some places that were particularly dangerous , we flew at an altitude of 35 feet , " to evade radar . " trust me , this is scary ! " he told idfblog.com . during the military build up to 2003 's @entity187 - led invasion of @entity188 , a @entity19 test dropped the biggest conventional weapon in the @entity191 's arsenal -- a so - called @entity192 -- known in military circles as " the mother of all bombs . " a @entity27 ejected the 21,000 - pound bomb out its rear cargo door high above @entity199 's @entity198 . the bomb fell to earth and detonated in a spectacular fire ball . in the past , the @entity202 attached small solid - fuel rocket engines to some c - 130s . the added power allowed steep takeoffs on super short runways . the @entity19 was n't designed to land on aircraft carriers . they 're too short . nonetheless , a @entity19 did it -- during a test in 1963 . that 's how amazing this plane is . but nothing lasts forever , and the @entity27 is no different . the @entity202 has been developing a so - called " super short takeoff and landing aircraft " that might replace the @entity19 after 2020 . the @entity216 calls it @entity217 . the proposed four - engine aircraft would be able to transport super heavy loads across oceans and to arrive and depart on short , improvised airfields . @entity191 planners apparently are hoping to create a @entity19 - inspired success story that will extend into the latter half of the 21st century .

@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) the little - known star of this week 's no. 1 car chase movie , " @entity5 " is n't a car*****1
it 's an airplane*****0
film producers hired a @entity10 c - 130 hercules to fly five cars 12,000 feet high , open a cargo door at the rear of the plane and parachute them out in a spectacular free - fall stunt*****1
@entity17 ! happy 60th birthday to the @entity19 -- the oldest continuously produced family of military planes in history*****1
@entity10 has been making these airplanes longer than the legendary b - 52 bomber and the famous @entity26 spy jet*****1
unlike those planes , the @entity27 has never become a household name*****0
the fact that " @entity32 " producers chose a plane that was designed in the 1950s tells you a little something about the success of the @entity19*****1
the film makes it appear as if another plane -- a @entity38 -- drops the cars*****0
but in real life , it took a @entity19 to pull it off*****0
shooting the scene posed unique logistical challenges , said stunt coordinator @entity44 in a featurette video about the mission*****0
" you start throwing all those cars out together -- you 've got to figure out spacing*****0
and these things drop very fast , " @entity49 said*****0
@entity51 of @entity52 co-piloted the stunt*****0
" we have to be very precise in our headings and our altitudes , " he says in the video*****0
the @entity19 is big*****0
it 's tough*****0
it 's versatile*****0
it refuels helicopters in flight*****0
it can fly a small military force and its heavy equipment around the world -- and land on short , unfinished airstrips*****0
at @entity10 's @entity0 , @entity1 , factory in 1955 , the governor of @entity1 christened the first production @entity69 by smashing a bottle of @entity72 water across its nose*****1
the plane then proceeded to take off from nearby @entity75*****0
on tuesday , exactly 60 years later , @entity1 gov. @entity76 recreated the ceremony -- christening a brand new @entity19 during a birthday party of sorts for @entity10 executives and military dignitaries*****1
" i 'm told that the 2,500th version of this aircraft is now on the ( assembly ) line inside this building , " @entity76 said*****0
" it transports , it becomes a war airplane as necessary and it is recognized as the true workhorse*****0

the rollers make it easier to move cargo around and launch it out the back of the airplane*****0
the legacy surrounding the @entity19 has been built by 60 years of successful missions , including : in 1989 , a flight crew aboard a @entity19 named @entity154 was credited with saving the crew of a @entity157 hurricane hunter airplane*****1
while flying through @entity159 , the @entity157 plane lost an engine and suffered damage to a second engine*****0
@entity163 57 happened to be nearby and located a safe place for the @entity157 plane to escape the eye of the deadly category 5 storm*****0
everyone returned safely to base*****0
in 2012 , @entity170 brig*****0
gen. @entity171 revealed how he flew a @entity19 on a successful hostage rescue mission to @entity173 , @entity174*****0
four c - 130s helped rescue passengers from a hijacked @entity178 flight in 1976*****1
" at some places that were particularly dangerous , we flew at an altitude of 35 feet , " to evade radar*****0
" trust me , this is scary ! " he told idfblog.com*****0
during the military build up to 2003 's @entity187 - led invasion of @entity188 , a @entity19 test dropped the biggest conventional weapon in the @entity191 's arsenal -- a so - called @entity192 -- known in military circles as " the mother of all bombs*****1
" a @entity27 ejected the 21,000 - pound bomb out its rear cargo door high above @entity199 's @entity198*****1
the bomb fell to earth and detonated in a spectacular fire ball*****0
in the past , the @entity202 attached small solid - fuel rocket engines to some c - 130s*****0
the added power allowed steep takeoffs on super short runways*****0
the @entity19 was n't designed to land on aircraft carriers*****0
they 're too short*****0
nonetheless , a @entity19 did it -- during a test in 1963*****0
that 's how amazing this plane is*****1
but nothing lasts forever , and the @entity27 is no different*****0
the @entity202 has been developing a so - called " super short takeoff and landing aircraft " that might replace the @entity19 after 2020*****0
the @entity216 calls it @entity217*****0
the proposed four - engine aircraft would be able to transport super heavy loads across oceans and to arrive and depart on short , improvised airfields*****0
@entity191 planners apparently are hoping to create a @entity19 - inspired success story that will extend into the latter half of the 21st century .*****0
