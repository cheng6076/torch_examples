the next time you take the kids on a pilgrimage to see the talking mouse or head down to @entity8 for some sun / sin , get a window seat and spend the moments before landing contemplating the seemingly endless swamp below*****0
because there are few places that represent the folly of man -- and the cost of redemption -- like the @entity20*****1
on approach into @entity23 or @entity24 , it just looks like squishy wasteland full of things that want to hurt you : snakes and scorpions , rats and roaches , gators and mosquitoes*****0

" and so , a century ago , some @entity49 dreamers decided to drain the swamp*****1
they decided to conquer that uninhabitable frontier known as @entity3*****0
and long before air conditioning , bug spray and @entity55 helped seal that vision , the @entity52 blasted and dug 2,000 miles of dams and dikes , ditches and pipes*****0
they did a hell of a job*****0
a watershed built for 2 million people now supports nearly 8 million , and another 50 million tourists each year*****0
but what they did n't know is that without this swamp , there can be no " good life " in @entity3*****0
there can be no life*****0
after a century of development , half the @entity20 is dead and the other half is on life support*****1
this is a problem , not just for the gators and snakes*****0
it is a problem for the eagles , panthers , snails , dolphins , hawks , manatees , flamingos , vase sponges , black bears and ghost orchids that make up the most unique , diverse wetlands in the world*****0
and most of all , it is a problem for people*****0
because most of the drinking water in @entity3 comes from the aquifers beneath the @entity20*****0
this 2 million - acre river of grass is not only the best form of hurricane protection , it also supports the multibillion - dollar fishing , shrimping and crabbing industries around the @entity105*****0
what was once a slow - moving river of gin - clear water became so sluggish and toxic in the 1990s that most of the life in @entity110 was wiped out -- and @entity49 woke up*****0
