( @entity1 ) it is a city transformed , swollen in size but shrunken in scope , anxiously awaiting what comes next*****0
on @entity7 's streets , you can easily find the uneasy legacy of @entity10 's longest war*****0
outside one mosque -- mixing with other men desperate for a day 's worth of casual manual labor -- are five men who months ago had one valuable skill @entity17 depended upon : they speak @entity18*****1
now however , their world has turned upon them*****0
they were , each for a different reason -- each for a reason they do not understand -- all fired from their jobs and then blacklisted , they say , meaning they can no longer get work with other government groups or @entity30 here*****1
the skill they once thrived off has left them isolated , and fearing reprisals*****0
they sleep in market stalls , and avoid traveling to see their families in case the threats they face are visited upon them*****0
" my family is still living in the provinces , " one of the men tells me*****0
" i can not go there*****0
i am living in a market , in one of the empty shops*****0
" another adds : " my family , everybody , give up on me , they are nervous*****0
" a third man -- all requested anonymity -- says : " right now i sleep here , on the street , in this mosque area*****0
" " we are in prison in @entity61 , " a fourth says*****0
the @entity10 @entity62 and @entity17 declined to comment for this story*****0
exclusive : the last @entity10 in @entity61 helicopters still buzz around the capital*****0
its population is five times what it was when @entity17 arrived here , even by the most conservative estimates , and the violence in the provinces means people swell it further still -- arriving in @entity7 's dusty , mountainous bowl of a city in order to avoid the fighting*****1
neighborhoods that were once massively over-priced cliques of foreigners living in " poppy palaces " -- villas allegedly bought from profiteers of the opium trade -- are now empty*****1
one road , forever pot - holed in the past decade , is now being covered over by @entity61 who , it seems , are finally reclaiming that street*****0
even @entity95 , the hackneyed pedestrian shopping road where new @entity92 arrivals would buy carpets or local trinkets , is more or less deserted*****0
one shopkeeper says it could be the embassy security warnings that are keeping people away now*****0
it is the same for the restaurants here that used to brim with contractors and @entity30 workers*****0
they are now empty , the sound of their heavy metal doors echoing across deserted tables*****0
it is immeasurably different to three years ago when i lived there*****0
drive out east -- past the women in burqas who sit on road bumps , holding their children , hoping drivers will slow enough to throw them change -- and you see roads lined with the detritus of @entity10 's war here*****1
huge lines of excavators , cherry - pickers , and forklift trucks sit idle*****1
at times it seemed there was little @entity10 would n't do , or try , to meets its often fluid goals in the country*****0
yet today , the machines that could have once moved small mountains do little more than gather dust*****0
exclusive : @entity61 woman forced to marry her rapist further down the road too are more winners - turned - losers of the @entity17 presence here*****1
vast supply chains once kept 120,000 troops fed and watered*****0
trucks lined the roads and climbed up to the military bases*****1
now the bases are gone , and the trucks that once supplied millions sit still*****1
their bosses may have fled abroad with their winnings , yet the drivers have been left behind , stuck with vehicles that cost them $ 30,000 to buy -- and $ 1,000 a year just to keep on the road -- but that would fetch just a tenth of that price now*****0
" the contracts were with big businessmen and commanders who were giving us very little and made themselves very rich and are now living comfortably in @entity164 , " one truck driver tells us*****0
yet still the wedding palaces proliferate*****0
along one stretch of road their endless , multiplying lights throb*****0
each night the houses seem packed -- the commitment to the future still is popular here , despite the uncertainty -- even if the lights that decorate them seem more and more like a symbol of leaving*****1
one set actually replicates the shape of an expensive hotel in @entity164*****0
the city 's lights do shine staggeringly and often constantly -- something the @entity184 never achieved during their rule here*****0
@entity17 's efforts to keep them on are reported to have involved diesel power stations that cost billions but were barely switched on*****0
the question many surely ask here -- as the last @entity10 troops prepare to retreat inside the @entity10 embassy by the end of next year -- is how much longer the lights will continue to glow*****0
