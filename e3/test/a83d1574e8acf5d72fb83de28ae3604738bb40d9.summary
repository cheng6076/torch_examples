@entity1 , @entity2 ( @entity3 ) sitting on a sunny bench in @entity1 's @entity5 , @entity0 dismisses the controversy surrounding the 100th anniversary friday of the massacre of @entity9 under the @entity10 with a wave of her hand . @entity0 , a 55 - year - old cleaner , says her family has had close friendships with @entity9 going back generations . " there is no such thing as genocide , " she says . " other people are trying to create hostility between us . " most @entity25 agree with @entity26 . ninety - one percent of @entity25 do not believe that the events of 1915 -- when , according to @entity9 , 1.5 million ethnic @entity9 were systematically killed in the final years of the @entity10 -- were genocide , according to a recent poll . it 's a sentiment shared by the @entity32 government , which denies that a genocide took place , maintaining that hundreds of thousands of @entity32 @entity35 and @entity9 @entity36 died in intercommunal violence around the bloody battlefields of @entity2 also disputes @entity9 's count of the numbers killed , putting it at 300,000 . it 's a heavily disputed position -- the killings are widely viewed by scholars as genocide and the @entity9 government and diaspora are lobbying for wider recognition in the international community . @entity9 prime minister @entity50 said friday in statement that @entity2 's @entity10 rulers had planned and carried out a " monstrous crime " in the years of @entity53 and called on more countries to recognize and condemn the genocide . many @entity9 living in @entity2 still feel treated as second - class citizens . however many have hope that @entity2 's younger generation is more willing to accept that a genocide occurred than their parents . " students are much , much more liberal , " says @entity63 , whose grandparents escaped the mass killings . @entity67 is a member of the delegation for the @entity70 commemoration and is writing her @entity72 thesis on the issue at @entity74 . " they have access to alternative information written in @entity78 , which is not taught in school ( in @entity2 ) . with more access to books , to alternative information , and with a larger democratization process , @entity2 will be able to face its history . " a century after her @entity9 ancestors escaped death in @entity87 , @entity67 says she is frustrated that @entity2 is unwilling to accept what happened . " your identity is denied by @entity2 , " she says . " they do not want to face this past . in @entity2 , the word @entity9 is still used as a curse . whenever you want to hurt somebody , you say , ' you are like an @entity9 . ' " @entity67 says an admission of genocide by @entity2 would largely be symbolic . while her grandparents lost their land , she has returned to their villages and she recognizes that trying to reclaim it would be impossible . " i do not believe that this is going to happen , " she says of the territorial claims made by many @entity9 . " one hundred years have passed . i went to my ancestors ' land , and i saw those @entity9 lands full of @entity109 people , who have five to 16 children per family , and i saw that it 's not @entity113 . it 's not my homeland that i had in my imagination . " a growing number of scholars and world leaders believe that what happened should be called genocide . @entity122 looks set to join the @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and some 20 other countries in labeling the atrocity a " genocide . " two weeks ago the @entity130 referred to mass killings as " the first genocide of the 20th century " -- a move that infuriated @entity32 president @entity134 , who called the claim " nonsense " and recalled his ambassador to the @entity137 . some notable countries do not recognize the killings as genocide , including the @entity142 and @entity143 and earlier this week @entity145 president @entity144 , wary of damaging relations with @entity2 amid growing unrest in the @entity148 , did not use the word genocide . there are several reasons why @entity2 maintains its position on the issue . @entity25 say that to most people there the term " genocide " is associated with @entity158 -- not the beloved founders of modern @entity2 . last year , the @entity32 government expressed condolences to @entity9 , and accepted that hundreds of thousands of their ancestors died as they were marched out of cities and towns in @entity165 and @entity113 in the waning years of the @entity10 . but the government called it a " necessary deportation " during the messy and violent period of transition leading up to @entity53 -- when many @entity9 radicals were threatening to side with @entity172 . @entity2 says that there was never a deliberate , ethnically - driven effort to exterminate the @entity9 population . " it was a wartime precaution , like the @entity145 relocated the @entity180 population during @entity181 , " says dr. @entity176 , @entity177 . @entity176 dismisses the drive for the " genocide " label as little more than a propaganda campaign being waged by the @entity9 diaspora . politics and timing is another issue . at a time when president @entity134 is in full campaign mode ahead of upcoming parliamentary elections , he is attempting to assuage concerns about unemployment and slowed growth by drumming up nationalist fervor with promises of a " @entity199 " akin to the glory days of the @entity10 . it 's hardly the time to label the country 's founders as murderers . that would n't play well with @entity25 , many of whom have gone through years of schooling that instilled in them a fierce pride in their past . in the same way that @entity145 schools often whitewashed the history of @entity145 settlers and their relations with @entity220 , @entity32 schools have long taken an airbrush to the " @entity25 . " the movement , which began in 1908 , was comprised of the army officers who were in power as the country transitioned from the hands of spoiled sultans to @entity228 -- the much - adored leader who came to power in 1923 and is credited with founding the modern @entity32 state . the taboo surrounding the use of the word genocide began to crack about a decade ago when two of @entity2 's best - selling international authors , @entity235 and @entity237 , joined other intellectuals in raising the issue of whether the country 's forefathers had committed genocide . @entity235 and @entity237 were met with crushing resistance . they were harangued in the court of public opinion , and tried in real - life court on charges of " insulting @entity248 . " since 2003 , @entity32 schools have been forbidden from using the term genocide . calling the events of 1915 a genocide would undermine the very narratives the @entity25 hold most dear , says @entity252 , a senior analyst at @entity253 who has studied @entity32 - @entity9 relations for a decade . she says the country simply is n't ready to dismantle the foundation it was built on , or stain the legacy of its founders . " @entity2 is still too young and too insecure to rewrite its history and question the events unfolding at the establishment of the republic , " @entity252 says . but in a statement issued to mark the anniversary of the killings , president @entity134 urged dialogue , saying " ... as descendants of two ancient peoples who a hundred years ago shared the same destiny whether in joy or in sorrow , our common responsibility , and calling , today is to heal century old wounds and re-establish our human ties once again . @entity2 will not remain indifferent to this responsibility and will continue to do its utmost for friendship and peace . " but there are other issues , including fears that an official recognition of genocide could unleash a flood of lawsuits against the @entity32 government . in 2006 , descendants of exiled @entity9 filed suit in a @entity145 court against two @entity122 banks for restitution of assets , based on evidence that @entity10 ministries required that seized @entity9 assets be turned over to the government and transferred to banks in @entity122 . one 97 - year - old @entity9 woman living in the @entity145 claims to have land deeds proving that her parents owned land that now houses an airport . her case is winding its way through the @entity32 court system , but her lawyer , @entity311 , says the genocide debate has no effect : " we have deeds , so we are following the law and politics do n't matter . " others say that the genocide is distracting the country from more pressing issues between @entity2 and @entity9 , like the closed border between the two hostile neighbors . @entity324 , a foreign policy expert at @entity325 , one of @entity2 's leading think tanks , argues that it is @entity9 , not @entity2 , which suffers most from the tensions surrounding the issue . and he says it is n't in @entity9 's best interest to push hard for a recognition of genocide that he does n't believe will ever come . " there 's no diplomatic relations between the countries , and that plays into why @entity25 think there 's a crazy diaspora obsessed with genocide , but that 's not true , " @entity324 says . " the best thing for @entity9 would be to enter into dialogue with @entity2 , normalize relations , and open the border . " meanwhile , the publicity surrounding the anniversary on friday has prompted debate amongst @entity25 of all ages . on sunday there will be a conference at @entity354 on the atrocity -- one of few in @entity2 that openly uses the term genocide . @entity358 , a 21 - year - old art management student with bright pink lipstick , is one of the few @entity25 who believes that her country should change course . " they keep referring to this as an ' @entity9 incident ' in quotations and ca n't call it genocide , " she says , boarding the metro to her classes at @entity363 .
