" we have proven to the world that we are a people who have embraced democracy and a people who seek a government by , for and for the people . " on election day , @entity3 queued for hours in hot weather to cast their vote . some of the biometric reader machines malfunctioned -- including the one at president @entity19 's polling station -- and voting had to be extended into the following day . but the technical issues did n't keep people from voting -- and in @entity109 , some voters cast their ballots with the aid of the light from their mobile phones . and even though some card readers did n't work in some places , many say they helped to cut down on vote rigging . @entity45 is n't the only obstacle facing the new president . the economy , crime and generating enough power to light up the country are other major issues . the pressure will soon be on @entity1 to deliver and there will be no excuses . if he fails , @entity3 will be waiting for him at the polls just four short years from now .

here are five reasons why one of the most fiercely - contested elections in the country 's history is so important*****1
for the first time in @entity3 's history , the opposition defeated the ruling party in democratic elections*****1
@entity1 , 72 , won @entity3 's presidential election , defeating incumbent @entity19 by about two million votes*****1

@entity1 's win comes after a long history of military rule , coups and botched attempts at democracy in the country*****1
many @entity3 told @entity4 that they saw president @entity19 as an ineffectual leader who was indecisive in dealing with the terror group @entity45 -- and weak on corruption*****1
@entity1 , who was campaigning for the fourth time , capitalized on these weaknesses and some analysts believe that his military background was an advantage for him*****0
@entity3 wanted a strong leader who could keep them safe from @entity45 's murderous raids -- and @entity1 also campaigned as a born - again democrat to allay fears about his strict military regime the last time around*****1

his campaign was also fiercely anti-corruption -- he ran under the slogan of " new broom , " and his supporters were often pictured holding brooms in the lead - up to the vote*****0
the elections were largely predicted to be violent and everyone , @entity3 included , expected the worst*****1
some families moved abroad and there was sporadic violence across the country in the lead up to the election*****0

many also praised president @entity19 's gracious and quick concession of defeat as it almost certainly prevented post-election violence*****0
