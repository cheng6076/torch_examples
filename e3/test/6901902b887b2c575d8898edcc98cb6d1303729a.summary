@entity7 ( @entity8 ) with the world watching , in his historic address to a joint session of the @entity3 , the first ever by a @entity5 prime minister , @entity0 surprised nobody by missing a great opportunity to dispel worries and tensions he raises with his revisionist views on history . during this 70th year anniversary of the end of @entity17 , @entity0 has been disappointing on @entity5 's wartime history because he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for @entity5 's wartime actions in @entity21 where the bitter legacies remain divisive . and this " @entity27 " is harmful to @entity5 's international image , riles @entity24 and @entity25 and thereby undermines the bilateral security agenda . @entity28 deliberately set the bar on history very low for @entity0 because the @entity32 administration is more focused on the shared perception with @entity7 that contemporary @entity24 is a threat requiring a collective response . strengthening the alliance with @entity5 and sealing the deal on the @entity38 trumps past misdeeds . forty years after the fall of @entity42 , and in the wake of @entity44 and @entity45 , @entity40 is in no position to lecture other nations about the horrors they inflicted and an inadequate reckoning for such misdeeds . president @entity32 pulled out all the stops to give @entity0 a red carpet welcome because he has delivered more on fulfilling @entity28 's longstanding security demands than all of his predecessors combined . but the newly expanded security role embraced by @entity5 enjoys little support among @entity5 . as a recent @entity59 indicates , only 23 % are in favor while 68 % are opposed . it is also problematic that @entity0 's stance on history is a factor in hindering trilateral security cooperation with @entity25 , something the @entity40 sees as essential . carefully tailoring his remarks to his audience , @entity0 hit the right notes in many respects , and even inched forward on history . he did express " eternal condolences " about the loss of @entity40 lives in @entity17 , and noted , " enemies that had fought each other so fiercely have become friends bonded in spirit . " that is welcome news , but @entity5 has been less successful in achieving rapprochement with other enemies , precisely because it has not taken the measure of the shared past . many nations play fast and loose with their unpleasant histories , but @entity0 is mounting a significant retreat from @entity5 's repentant views expressed and embraced since the mid- 1990s , and actively promotes a valorizing and exonerating history under the banner of patriotic education . he is putting his personal agenda on history ahead of the national interest and therefore not meeting the test of statesmanship . of course there is nothing that @entity0 could say that would satisfy @entity24 or @entity25 , two nations that suffered longest and most from @entity5 depredations from the late 19th century . but that does n't mean he should n't try a bit harder . what @entity0 said is , " post war , we started out on our path bearing in mind feelings of deep remorse over the war . our actions brought suffering to the peoples in @entity115 countries . we must not avert our eyes from that . i will uphold the views expressed by the previous prime ministers in this regard . " essentially outsourcing " apology and war responsibility " to his predecessors gets low marks on the empathy and sincerity scale . it is also troubling that throughout his political career , @entity0 has worked to undermine and repudiate previous @entity132 . rather than merely " upholding " what others have said it might have been better for @entity0 to prove his critics wrong by clearly expressing an apology . in @entity5 , there has been a lot of pressure on @entity0 to explicitly invoke the language of the 1995 @entity141 that stands as the most forthright apology and acknowledgment of war responsibility . even the conservative @entity146 newspaper urged him to do so . @entity147 clearly condemned " mistaken national policy , " " self - righteous nationalism , " " colonial rule " and " aggression , " but @entity0 has spent his entire political career renouncing this so - called " masochistic " view of @entity5 's wartime history . fatalistically , @entity0 said , " history is harsh . what is done can not be undone . " well , yes that is self - evident but this should not mean the door is closed on apologies , acts of contrition and atonement and a clear reckoning of the harsh history that still isolates @entity5 in @entity21 . @entity0 is certainly right that the neighbors are playing the history card and relentlessly hammering @entity5 on the anvil of history , but they were handed the hammer by @entity5 . given @entity0 's evasive track record about the comfort women system of sexual slavery , a forthright apology or acknowledgment of state involvement was never in the cards . what @entity0 managed , however , was even weaker than expected : " armed conflicts have always made women suffer the most . in our age , we must realize the kind of world where finally women are free from human rights abuses . " this cavalier " sh * t happens " attitude towards the comfort women system undermines @entity5 's dignity and represents a step backward . in recent remarks @entity0 says he upholds the 1993 @entity193 statement , but he has flouted it and over the past year members of his party have been busy controverting this forthright admission of responsibility and coercive recruitment . moreover , @entity0 's support for patriotic education and pressures on textbook publishers has effectively erased comfort women from what is taught in junior high schools , contravening what the @entity193 statement promised . in the only textbook that does mention them , the government insisted on the removal of a former comfort woman 's testimony and insertion of a disclaimer regarding what it regards as a lack of evidence . to counter criticism , @entity0 now refers to @entity5 's comfort women system in terms of human trafficking , a linguistic ploy to obscure state responsibility for operating this system and make it appear he gets 21st century concerns . human trafficking , however , highlights the role of private brokers in coercively recruiting these women in line with revisionist attempts to shift responsibility from the @entity5 military and government authorities of the day . revisionists prefer to blame the @entity25 brokers , but they were acting at the behest of @entity5 officials who surely knew of the abuses and ensured that the comfort women could not escape their hell . in his speech @entity0 also referred to shared values of democracy and freedom . this too is welcome news because over the past year @entity0 has presided over an orchestrated attack on the @entity250 newspaper for its coverage of the comfort women system , packed @entity254 's management with like - minded reactionaries and pressured critics out of their jobs . indeed the @entity258 ran an article on april 26 implicating @entity260 in the axing of a prominent tv pundit who made the mistake of criticizing @entity0 . the foreign press has also exposed @entity5 government harassment targeting their reporting , especially regarding the whitewashing of history , and attempts to smear the integrity of those who would n't go along . in addition , journalists were told not to interview certain @entity0 critics . journalists acknowledge this is what government spin doctors normally do and have done in @entity5 for some time , but under @entity0 the rules of engagement appear to be nastier . @entity0 got lots of applause from @entity40 politicians who seemed to enjoy his reference to an " alliance of hope .

@entity7 ( @entity8 ) with the world watching , in his historic address to a joint session of the @entity3 , the first ever by a @entity5 prime minister , @entity0 surprised nobody by missing a great opportunity to dispel worries and tensions he raises with his revisionist views on history*****1
during this 70th year anniversary of the end of @entity17 , @entity0 has been disappointing on @entity5 's wartime history because he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for @entity5 's wartime actions in @entity21 where the bitter legacies remain divisive*****1
and this " @entity27 " is harmful to @entity5 's international image , riles @entity24 and @entity25 and thereby undermines the bilateral security agenda*****1
@entity28 deliberately set the bar on history very low for @entity0 because the @entity32 administration is more focused on the shared perception with @entity7 that contemporary @entity24 is a threat requiring a collective response*****1
strengthening the alliance with @entity5 and sealing the deal on the @entity38 trumps past misdeeds*****0
forty years after the fall of @entity42 , and in the wake of @entity44 and @entity45 , @entity40 is in no position to lecture other nations about the horrors they inflicted and an inadequate reckoning for such misdeeds*****0
president @entity32 pulled out all the stops to give @entity0 a red carpet welcome because he has delivered more on fulfilling @entity28 's longstanding security demands than all of his predecessors combined*****1
but the newly expanded security role embraced by @entity5 enjoys little support among @entity5*****0
as a recent @entity59 indicates , only 23 % are in favor while 68 % are opposed*****0
it is also problematic that @entity0 's stance on history is a factor in hindering trilateral security cooperation with @entity25 , something the @entity40 sees as essential*****1
carefully tailoring his remarks to his audience , @entity0 hit the right notes in many respects , and even inched forward on history*****1
he did express " eternal condolences " about the loss of @entity40 lives in @entity17 , and noted , " enemies that had fought each other so fiercely have become friends bonded in spirit*****1
" that is welcome news , but @entity5 has been less successful in achieving rapprochement with other enemies , precisely because it has not taken the measure of the shared past*****0
many nations play fast and loose with their unpleasant histories , but @entity0 is mounting a significant retreat from @entity5 's repentant views expressed and embraced since the mid- 1990s , and actively promotes a valorizing and exonerating history under the banner of patriotic education*****1
he is putting his personal agenda on history ahead of the national interest and therefore not meeting the test of statesmanship*****1
of course there is nothing that @entity0 could say that would satisfy @entity24 or @entity25 , two nations that suffered longest and most from @entity5 depredations from the late 19th century*****1
but that does n't mean he should n't try a bit harder*****0
what @entity0 said is , " post war , we started out on our path bearing in mind feelings of deep remorse over the war*****0
our actions brought suffering to the peoples in @entity115 countries*****0
we must not avert our eyes from that*****0
i will uphold the views expressed by the previous prime ministers in this regard*****0
" essentially outsourcing " apology and war responsibility " to his predecessors gets low marks on the empathy and sincerity scale*****0
it is also troubling that throughout his political career , @entity0 has worked to undermine and repudiate previous @entity132*****0
rather than merely " upholding " what others have said it might have been better for @entity0 to prove his critics wrong by clearly expressing an apology*****0
in @entity5 , there has been a lot of pressure on @entity0 to explicitly invoke the language of the 1995 @entity141 that stands as the most forthright apology and acknowledgment of war responsibility*****1
even the conservative @entity146 newspaper urged him to do so*****0
@entity147 clearly condemned " mistaken national policy , " " self - righteous nationalism , " " colonial rule " and " aggression , " but @entity0 has spent his entire political career renouncing this so - called " masochistic " view of @entity5 's wartime history*****1
fatalistically , @entity0 said , " history is harsh*****1
what is done can not be undone*****0
" well , yes that is self - evident but this should not mean the door is closed on apologies , acts of contrition and atonement and a clear reckoning of the harsh history that still isolates @entity5 in @entity21*****1
@entity0 is certainly right that the neighbors are playing the history card and relentlessly hammering @entity5 on the anvil of history , but they were handed the hammer by @entity5*****1
given @entity0 's evasive track record about the comfort women system of sexual slavery , a forthright apology or acknowledgment of state involvement was never in the cards*****1
what @entity0 managed , however , was even weaker than expected : " armed conflicts have always made women suffer the most*****0
in our age , we must realize the kind of world where finally women are free from human rights abuses*****0
" this cavalier " sh * t happens " attitude towards the comfort women system undermines @entity5 's dignity and represents a step backward*****1
in recent remarks @entity0 says he upholds the 1993 @entity193 statement , but he has flouted it and over the past year members of his party have been busy controverting this forthright admission of responsibility and coercive recruitment*****1
moreover , @entity0 's support for patriotic education and pressures on textbook publishers has effectively erased comfort women from what is taught in junior high schools , contravening what the @entity193 statement promised*****1
in the only textbook that does mention them , the government insisted on the removal of a former comfort woman 's testimony and insertion of a disclaimer regarding what it regards as a lack of evidence*****0
to counter criticism , @entity0 now refers to @entity5 's comfort women system in terms of human trafficking , a linguistic ploy to obscure state responsibility for operating this system and make it appear he gets 21st century concerns*****1
human trafficking , however , highlights the role of private brokers in coercively recruiting these women in line with revisionist attempts to shift responsibility from the @entity5 military and government authorities of the day*****1
revisionists prefer to blame the @entity25 brokers , but they were acting at the behest of @entity5 officials who surely knew of the abuses and ensured that the comfort women could not escape their hell*****0
in his speech @entity0 also referred to shared values of democracy and freedom*****0
this too is welcome news because over the past year @entity0 has presided over an orchestrated attack on the @entity250 newspaper for its coverage of the comfort women system , packed @entity254 's management with like - minded reactionaries and pressured critics out of their jobs*****1
indeed the @entity258 ran an article on april 26 implicating @entity260 in the axing of a prominent tv pundit who made the mistake of criticizing @entity0*****0
the foreign press has also exposed @entity5 government harassment targeting their reporting , especially regarding the whitewashing of history , and attempts to smear the integrity of those who would n't go along*****1
in addition , journalists were told not to interview certain @entity0 critics*****0
journalists acknowledge this is what government spin doctors normally do and have done in @entity5 for some time , but under @entity0 the rules of engagement appear to be nastier*****1
@entity0 got lots of applause from @entity40 politicians who seemed to enjoy his reference to an " alliance of hope*****1
" that 's not exactly how @entity288 feel about the disproportionate base - hosting burden they bear*****0
some 75 % of @entity40 bases are concentrated in @entity292 and @entity40 bases cover nearly 20 % of the land*****0
in a series of elections and in opinion polls , @entity288 have voiced their opposition to this situation*****0
in november 2014 they elected a governor who opposes the building of a new airbase for the @entity40 in the pristine waters of @entity304 in northern @entity292 , kicking the once popular incumbent out of office because he gave the green light for this project*****0
officials on both sides of the @entity311 have reiterated support for proceeding with the new base as part of a plan to reduce the @entity40 military footprint in @entity292 , but @entity288 remain unconvinced and find that the democratic expression of their opposition is resolutely ignored*****0
