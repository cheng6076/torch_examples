( @entity1 ) @entity0 remembers the fear and feeling of helplessness from being on the @entity6 flight that made an emergency landing in @entity8 , @entity9 . " i thought we were done , " he said thursday , one day later . " there was no doubt in my mind that we were n't going to land . " @entity0 was flying with his brother , his girlfriend and his 8 - month - old son when he says a flight attendant came over the speaker asking for someone who was medically trained to help with a sick passenger . minutes later , @entity0 says , the attendant announced there was a pressurization problem and told passengers to prepare for the emergency landing . " you 're going to feel dizzy and woozy and lightheaded , and you 're not going to be able to breathe , " @entity0 recalled the flight attendant saying . the @entity27 on wednesday initially reported a pressurization problem with @entity29 , and said it would investigate . it later issued a statement that did not reference any pressurization issues . " it was like being trapped and you could n't do anything . you have no control over it . your body just felt pressured , " @entity0 said . @entity0 said his girlfriend was seeing spots and that " when i was blinking , it was really bright . i could barely see . " according to @entity42 , spokeswoman for @entity6 , three passengers reported a loss of consciousness while on the flight . fifteen passengers were examined by medical personnel at the @entity8 airport , but no one was transported to the hospital , she said . the spokeswoman said that maintenance personnel found no indication of a pressurization problem with the aircraft , an @entity55 , and that the airline continues to investigate the cause . an official with the @entity59 told @entity1 that the agency is in communication with the @entity27 and @entity6 to gather information on the incident to better understand what took place . @entity66 was the nurse on board who attended to the first sick passenger . " there was a woman , very lethargic , very nauseous , turning gray , just not looking good , " @entity66 said . after administering oxygen to the woman , @entity66 , a nurse at @entity72 in @entity73 , returned to her seat . soon after , @entity66 said , she was called up again by the flight attendant after another women near the first started to lose consciousness . " it was something that was affecting oxygen in that area , " which was near the middle of the plane , she said . @entity66 said she had to return to her seat after feeling lightheaded . there were 84 passengers on board the plane , including nine crew members . flight 5622 was originally scheduled to fly from @entity93 to @entity94 , @entity73 . the plane descended 28,000 feet in three minutes . " it would feel like a roller coaster -- when you 're coming over the top and you 're going down , " @entity1 aviation analyst @entity96 said , describing how such a descent would feel . " you know that these pilots knew they were in a very grave and very serious situation . " @entity0 , flying to visit his parents with their only grandchild , was glad that roller coaster ride ended safely .
