( @entity1 ) @entity0 had a zest for life . by the time she finished college she had already visited 37 countries . after graduating from college she was working in @entity8 and thinking about going to law school . her life was full of promise , but all that ended suddenly when she was just 24 years old . in @entity13 , @entity12 was looking forward to her daughter coming home for @entity16 when she received a call from @entity0 's cell phone . in an interview with @entity1 , @entity0 's mom said she " picked up the phone and answered it , ' @entity22 , ca n't wait to see you ' -- @entity25 - bear is our nickname for her -- and it was @entity29 . " with groceries in hand , @entity0 's boyfriend , @entity30 , had arrived at her apartment to make dinner and found @entity0 collapsed on the floor . the fire department and paramedics were already on the scene . the attendant at the front desk had heard @entity0 screaming for help and called 911 . " [ the paramedics ] tried to revive her with @entity45 and while they were in the apartment , i think she had a heart attack and then two more on the way to the hospital in the ambulance , and another one in the hospital , and she never woke up , " @entity0 's father , @entity42 , said . @entity12 knew it was serious when the emergency room doctor said they needed to come to the hospital in @entity57 , @entity58 . she said the doctor asked her whether @entity0 was using any birth control . according to @entity12 , when she told him @entity0 was using the @entity62 , " he said well there 's a link between @entity62 and pulmonary embolisms , " @entity12 said . @entity42 said doctors removed the @entity62 immediately . " it was , it was a nightmare , " he added . by the time @entity42 and @entity12 arrived at the @entity69 , @entity0 was in a coma , in the @entity71 . " they had determined that @entity0 had no brain activity and that because of her heart attacks they basically told us that she was brain dead and that 's it , " @entity42 said , fighting back tears . hospital records cited the @entity62 as a risk factor for @entity0 's multiple pulmonary embolisms . records confirm what @entity0 's parents told @entity1 : that a blood clot started in an artery / vein in her right thigh and traveled to her lungs , causing " massive " pulmonary embolisms and " multiple episodes of cardiac arrest " on the way to the hospital and overnight . the @entity95 never heard their daughter 's voice again . she died on @entity16 . " we miss her so much , " @entity12 said . less than a year later , 2,000 miles away in @entity100 , @entity99 had the scare of her life . @entity104 , it turns out , was a classmate of @entity0 's at @entity105 . she 's training to compete in the @entity107 in skeleton , a type of high - speed downhill sledding . the scare that shook her in august 2012 threatened her @entity107 dreams . within weeks of starting the @entity62 , @entity104 said she collapsed during training , unable to breathe . " i mean i was struggling , i was struggling to breathe . " @entity104 said . " it 's like an elephant was sitting on my chest all the time . " after seeing five doctors who were unable to tell her what was wrong , she finally got a diagnosis from a pulmonologist . he told her he thought she had blood clots in her lungs . " i said , you know i started taking this birth control , is it related to this ? " @entity104 said . " and he was like , yeah , i definitely think that you have blood clots and it 's from the birth control . " x-rays , followed by an ultrasound and a @entity134 scan , revealed that @entity99 's life was in danger . " [ the doctor ] started to tell me , you have multiple pulmonary embolisms in both lungs , " said @entity99 . " they 're sending an ambulance , they 're going to come and they 're going to rush you to the emergency room ... it just really took me by surprise and you know i knew it was something bad but i never imagined it would be something like that . " according to her hospital discharge papers , the @entity104 was using " was probably the risk factor " for her pulmonary embolisms . @entity104 went from peak physical condition to using a breathing machine . she was put on blood thinners , too . her doctors told her it 's too risky to use hormonal birth control again . " easy . safe . that 's really how it was presented -- easy , safe , low - dose hormone -- you know , and it turns out it was n't . it was n't that at all , " she said . even though @entity62 has about the same risk for blood clots as newer birth control pills , @entity104 said she wishes she had known that the incidence of life - threatening blood clots is double with @entity62 compared to older birth control pills . " there are other options out there for birth control that have risks , but not doubling the risks , " @entity104 told @entity1 . " if i would have known that i never would have taken it . " and thinking about what happened to her classmate , @entity0 , @entity104 said , " i think if i knew what i know now and , you know , if @entity0 had known that , a number of people , i think that they would have made a slightly different choice . " the @entity62 is one of the most popular birth control products on the market . a flexible ring inserted vaginally , it releases a combination of hormones . by 2010 as many as 830,000 women were using the vaginal ring as a contraceptive method , according to the @entity199 , a nonprofit organization advancing sexual and reproductive health worldwide . at least 10.5 million women use hormonal birth control pills . the @entity62 was approved by the @entity203 in 2001 and became available to women in the @entity205 in 2002 . the @entity207 pharmaceutical company , @entity206 , developed the device and manufactured it until 2007 when the company was sold to @entity210 , which was then acquired by @entity211 in 2009 . according to @entity211 , the @entity62 is sold in more than 50 countries , and 44 million prescriptions have been filled for women in the @entity205 alone . the @entity62 dispenses what 's called a third - generation progestin , or synthetic hormone . when it first came on the market , the device was touted as a breakthrough -- inserted vaginally to release a " continuous low dose of hormones . " it stays in for three weeks , so no bother of taking a daily birth control pill . the ring was branded in a television commercial as " a different way to do birth control " and " oh ! it 's easy to use . " convenient ? absolutely . but safe ? that depends on whom you ask . the @entity95 had no idea the @entity62 birth control their daughter had been using for four years had already been linked to other women 's deaths , according to unconfirmed claims of problems reported to the @entity203 . @entity211 acknowledges a very small risk of blood clots but stands by its product , saying , " there is substantial evidence to support the safety and efficacy of @entity62 . " while studies have shown that the number of severe adverse events is extremely low -- fewer than 11 cases per 10,000 women who use it for a year -- the families who have lost loved ones point out that the incidence of life - threatening blood clots is double with @entity62 than with older birth control pills . since the mid- 1990s there have been multiple studies suggesting that while third - generation progestins are generally safe , they are approximately twice as likely to cause blood clots than older , second - generation birth control pills . @entity211 denied @entity1 's request for an on - camera interview . instead , it gave this statement : " while there is a very small risk of a blood clot when using nuvaring or any combined hormonal contraceptive , this risk is much less than the risk of blood clots during pregnancy and the immediate post-partum period . " among 10,000 women , between five and 20 women run the risk of developing a serious blood clot during pregnancy ; the risk increases to between 40 and 65 women during the 12 - week postpartum period . among 10,000 women in a year using combination hormonal contraceptives -- that includes birth control pills , the ring and the patch -- the risk of developing serious blood clots ranges between three and 12 women . nuvaring users are on the higher end of that risk . two studies conducted in 2011 and 2012 reveal the risk of developing a serious blood clot among @entity62 users is 11.4 and 8.3 per 10,000 women in a year , respectively . the @entity62 's label was updated in 2013 by the @entity203 with information about both studies . the @entity95 , @entity99 , and 3,800 others sued @entity211 . according to claims filed in federal and state courts , the lawsuits allege @entity206 , the original manufacturer of the @entity62 , " failed to adequately warn consumers about a heightened risk of blood clots associated with the use of @entity62 , even though the manufacturer was aware that @entity62 posed greater risks than other hormonal contraceptives . " in february , without admitting any wrongdoing , @entity211 agreed to pay $ 100 million in damages . but the @entity95 did not settle , insisting @entity211 be held accountable for what the family said was @entity211 's failure to properly warn users of the risk . they believe what @entity211 is getting away with is " criminal . " " i do n't understand why a company in the @entity205 would allow that kind of product on the market . it 's not the way @entity205 do business , " @entity42 said .
