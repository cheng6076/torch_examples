( @entity4 ) after years of making the case that the education of athletes is paramount , the @entity0 now says it has no legal responsibility to make sure education is actually delivered . on its website , the @entity0 prominently states , " it 's our commitment -- and our responsibility -- to give young people opportunities to learn , play and succeed . " and later , it says that " in the collegiate model of sports , the young men and women competing on the field or court are students first , athletes second . " but the @entity0 is taking a very different position in response to a lawsuit filed by former @entity24 athletes . the lawsuit claimed the students did n't get an education because they were caught up in the largest known academic fraud scandal in @entity0 history . in its response , the @entity0 says it has no legal responsibility " to ensure the academic integrity of the courses offered to student - athletes at its member institutions . " even with pages of online information about academic standards , and even though the @entity0 has established a system of academic eligibility and accountability that it boasts of regularly , @entity0 attorneys wrote in this court filing that " the @entity0 did not assume a duty to ensure the quality of the education of student - athletes , " and " the @entity0 does not have ' direct , day - to - day , operational control ' " over member institutions like @entity24 . " it 's nonsense . it 's double talk , " said @entity51 , a former athletic - academic director who is now president of @entity52 for academic integrity in collegiate sport . " if you look at their basic core principles , it 's all about academics , the experience , the integration of academics , and the education of the student is paramount , " @entity51 said . " they seem to talk out of both sides of their mouths . " the @entity0 referred calls for comment to an online statement , which read in part : the @entity0 believes that the lawsuit misunderstands the @entity0 's role with respect to its member schools and ignores the myriad steps the @entity0 has taken to assist student - athletes in being equipped to excel both in the classroom and on the playing field . " this case is troubling for a number of reasons , not the least of which is that the law does not and has never required the @entity0 to ensure that every student - athlete is actually taking full advantage of the academic and athletic opportunities provided to them , " said @entity83 , @entity0 chief legal officer . in its response to the lawsuit , it also likened its role to that of the @entity97 or @entity98 , and said that those entities are not sued every time a lawyer or doctor acts inappropriately . the scandal at @entity24 involved thousands of athletes who , over 18 years , were funneled into classes that never met , where advisers fudged grades and accepted plagiarism so that athletes who were falling behind in class could remain eligible to play sports . @entity111 , the @entity24 whistleblower turned @entity0 critic , has for years said that athletes across the country are accepted to colleges even though they 're academically underprepared and then pushed into classes where little work is required . the system of eligibility that the @entity0 brags about , she says , is a sham . " why do we go through the trouble of compliance if we ca n't legitimize that the courses are real and the education is real anyway ? it makes no sense , " said @entity111 , who recently wrote a book about the @entity24 scandal called " cheated . " " if they ca n't legitimize that the academics are real and take no responsibility for that , then why certify students semester after semester to play ? it 's lost its meaning for me . " the @entity0 's claim that it 's hands - off when it comes to athletics seems to be a direct contradiction of what the organization has been repeating for years , not just in the rhetoric on its website , but in speeches by its president , @entity145 , and in court defending itself from numerous lawsuits over paying athletes . for example , before it lost a case filed by former @entity151 player @entity150 , suing for the right of athletes to make money off their images and likenesses , the @entity0 stood on the pillar of amateurism , insisting that college athletes are paid with an education . that 's the defense the @entity0 is now using in another class action filed by big - time sports attorney @entity164 , seeking to make college sports a free market where athletes are paid salaries based on their value . in response , the @entity0 said that what sets college sports apart from pros is education : consistent with " its commitment to amateurism , member institutions conduct their athletics programs for students who choose to participate in intercollegiate athletics as a part of their educational experience and in accordance with @entity0 bylaws . " attorney @entity185 , who represented both @entity150 and now the @entity24 athletes , said this : " this startling inconsistency is unfortunately all too symptomatic of the @entity0 's shifting rhetoric and faltering commitment to its college athletes . @entity0 president @entity145 has repeatedly proposed that ' what we live for is the education of our athletes , ' but the @entity0 's record tells a far different story . " but @entity198 , professor of sport management at @entity200 , said it 's not realistic to think that the @entity0 would regulate every professor and every course an athlete might take at each university across the country . " i understand , i think , where the @entity0 is coming from . we would not let the @entity0 come in and tell us how to run our chemistry department at @entity200 , " he said . " it sounds like someone is trying to say the @entity0 should have been supervising that department at the @entity24 , and there 's no logic to that , " he said . " the people who are saying the @entity0 should be held accountable for academics at every school are just looking for an opportunity to throw rocks at the @entity0 . " @entity24 , which was also sued , has admitted to the fraud , but also asked for a judge to throw out the case , saying the athletes waited too long -- seven years -- to sue and the " educational malpractice " theory does n't apply . @entity24 claims it is protected by state law . this is reminiscent of another @entity0 reversal . the @entity0 , which was founded a century ago to protect athletes from " dangerous and exploitive athletic practices , " now says it does not enforce health and safety rules . in fact , in response to a lawsuit filed by the family of a player who died in 2011 , the @entity0 wrote : " the @entity0 denies that it has a legal duty to protect student - athletes . " a @entity4 investigation found that the @entity0 has failed to open investigations in several cases where safety rules allegedly were broken . it has also fallen behind in imposing rules for concussions -- far behind even the @entity244 . @entity245 , president of the @entity246 , and a leading thorn in the @entity0 's side for decades , said this latest backpedaling from the @entity0 leaves him wondering why the organization exists at all . " there 's nothing left the @entity0 can claim it does that is beneficial to college athletes or society . one has to wonder what does the @entity0 do if it does n't protect players ? if it does n't play a role in the education of college athletics ? it begs the question of why does the @entity0 exist -- and why does it have a tax exemption .
