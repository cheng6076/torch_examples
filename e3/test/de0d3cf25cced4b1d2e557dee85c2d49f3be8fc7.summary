@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) [ breaking news update at 11:45 p.m. et ] two african - americans -- @entity5 and @entity6 -- were elected to the @entity7 on tuesday , meaning three of the six council members are black . [ previous story , published at 6:52 p.m. et ] the skies grew ominous and the radio crackled with warnings of flash floods . amid the rain , @entity0 opened its polls at 6 a.m. for municipal elections that traditionally have drawn very few out to vote . but today was different . this was the first city election since white police officer @entity20 shot and killed unarmed black teenager @entity21 last august . since then , this @entity23 suburb of 21,000 people has gone through epic upheaval with revelations of systemic discrimination against african - americans by law enforcement and the courts . there 's widespread feeling , especially in the @entity35 - @entity34 community , that if the turnout is low , then all the protests , the investigations , the calls for change will have been in vain . @entity23 elections officials said they had no indication that turnout in tuesday 's election would be any different than other years . but among the candidates inspired to run by the events that transpired here , there was hope of seeing greater voter participation . " that is what our democracy is about , " said @entity6 , a 40 - year - old lawyer and criminal justice professor who also is a part - time municipal judge in nearby @entity52 . @entity6 is running against @entity57 , a retired electrical plant employee , in @entity58 . that area includes @entity60 , where @entity21 was killed , and the @entity62 business corridor that felt the brunt of the protests and the vandalism . charred , heavily damaged buildings stand as scars of @entity0 's despair and anger . both @entity6 and @entity57 are black , and no matter the outcome , one of them will double the @entity35 - @entity34 representation on the council . even though 70 % of @entity0 's 21,000 people are black , five of the six current @entity7 members and the mayor are white . the council was cited along with the @entity80 , which has three black officers , as a symbol of white power in a majority black city . " we have to get out of this law enforcement for business , " said candidate @entity85 , coordinator of the computer network security program at @entity87 . @entity85 referred to the scathing report by the @entity34 @entity92 that found @entity0 issued fines and traffic tickets to generate revenue for the city . " that 's not a good thing , " @entity85 said as he stood in the drizzle at a polling station , hoping to persuade voters who were still undecided . the polls close here at 7 p.m. results are not expected until a few hours later . @entity104 , a 67 - year - old retired airline pilot , said he voted for @entity105 , a former mayor who launched the " @entity107 " campaign last fall to raise money for mom and pop businesses that were hurt by the looting and vandalism . some residents see @entity105 as being a part of the establishment , part of the problem . but @entity104 asked why no one complained when @entity105 was mayor . he said @entity21 's shooting brought a lot of bad things to light . " we did n't realize the effect some of the institutional problems had on poor people , " he said . " some things need to be changed and we are aware of that . " by midafternoon , @entity105 said the numbers looked good . at a church where voters from all three wards were casting ballots , he predicted a 40 - 50 % turnout . when the rain let up for a few minutes , a stream of voters trickled into the @entity140 in downtown @entity0 to cast their votes . @entity142 and @entity143 both voted for @entity144 , a political novice who attracted attention as a white man who routinely stood with protesters on the front lines . he speaks often of having married a black woman and having a biracial teenage son . " i wanted change , " said @entity153 , 60 , who is black . his wife is white . he said the couple moved to @entity0 after he retired from the @entity157 in 1995 because they felt it was a racially welcoming place . but now , after all the problems rose to the surface , it 's time for fresh blood on the @entity7 , @entity153 said . that 's why they chose @entity144 over @entity105 . " quit using law enforcement as a revenue stream , " he said . " that 's like using the military to go into places and looting them . the police are supposed to keep order . " @entity172 came to the polls with her husband and two little girls in tow . she voted for @entity5 , a former @entity178 cosmetics sales director who resigned her job in january to run for office . @entity181 echoed the thoughts of other @entity0 residents who experienced something new in this election : candidates coming to their door . past elections have not seen the kind of canvassing activity that took place in the last few weeks . " one thing we really liked is ( @entity194 ) came to our door and talked to us about her desire to make change in our neighborhood , " @entity181 said . " she 's going to be hands on . she lives in the neighborhood as well , and has for the past 36 years . we were kind of taken by that . " @entity105 , the former mayor turned @entity7 candidate , campaigned that @entity0 would benefit from his experience more than a newcomer , saying his contacts from almost three decades in politics would be an invaluable asset in getting @entity0 back on its feet . " i understand that feeling , " @entity105 said of those who feel he 's too entrenched in the city 's old guard , " but those individuals do n't know me . " the city is required to approve a new budget by the end of june and the new council will have to look for alternative sources of revenue to replace the $ 3 million or so lost from money generated by traffic tickets and fines . " that amount will drop significantly , " @entity105 said . the rain began to fall again as the @entity229 got in their car . it was expected to continue off and on through the day and night . but about 5 , just when many voters were leaving work , the sun shone brilliantly . overheard at one precinct : good weather brought out the worst in @entity0 last august . maybe today , it would bring out the best .
