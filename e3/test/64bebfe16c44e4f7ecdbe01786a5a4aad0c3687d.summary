( @entity6 ) if i had to describe the @entity4 - @entity3 relationship in one word it would be " overmatched*****1
" we 're playing checkers on the @entity10 game board and @entity11 's playing three - dimensional chess*****0
@entity3 has no problem reconciling its bad and contradictory behavior while we twist ourselves into knots over our tough choices , all the while convincing ourselves that @entity4 's policy on the nuclear issue is on the right track*****1
@entity3 is n't 10 feet tall in this region , but by making the nuclear issue the be-all and end - all that is supposed to reduce @entity3 's power , the @entity4 is only making @entity11 taller*****1
consider the following : the @entity4 - @entity3 relationship is not symmetrical*****1
it 's not as if we both are doing terrible things and are looking for a fair and equitable compromise to stop our respective bad behaviors*****0
@entity3 is about to try a @entity4 citizen and @entity33 reporter and we have made a judgment that even while we protest , we will keep the nuclear issue separated not just from this case but from @entity3 's serial abuse of human rights , including the behavior of its @entity41 militias in @entity42*****1
i can only hope there is a carefully orchestrated behind - the - scenes plan to have @entity3 release @entity46*****0
if not , we 're legitimizing a bad regime and compromising @entity4 values and interests in the process by not ensuring that all @entity4 being held by @entity3 come out as part of the nuclear deal*****1
@entity4 is alienating some of our closest allies because of the @entity3 deal , and @entity3 is picking up new ones and bolstering relations with old ones who are growing more dependent because they see @entity3 's power rising*****1
our friends are n't perfect , particularly the @entity62 and even the @entity63*****0
but we need them precisely because @entity3 is rising*****0
sadly , the administration is sending signals that cutting a deal on the nuclear issue takes precedence over their priorities*****0
in the meantime , @entity3 's allies , @entity76 's @entity70 , @entity71 and now the @entity72 -- not proxies , but instruments of convenience -- see what 's happening and are willing to play and cooperate even more in the @entity3 game*****0
the @entity81 , too , realize that the nuclear issue gives them cover to sell sophisticated missile defense systems and soon to export even more to gain influence and hard currency*****1
we 're losing friends ; @entity3 is gaining them*****1
and in one of the cruelest ironies , @entity3 's way back into the global economy is as a result of the very issue that made it such a pariah : the nuclear issue*****1
as the @entity96 world melts down and lacks a traditional epicenter of strength and power , ( @entity100 , @entity42 , @entity70 ) , @entity3 is rising*****0
the argument here is not that @entity3 is taking over the @entity10*****0
but in its zone of influence , a zone critical to the @entity4 -- @entity70 , @entity42 , the @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 -- it is expanding its influence , not contracting*****1
@entity110 does n't play this kind of game well*****0
it is tripping all over itself trying to figure out how to combat @entity115 in @entity70 and yet not empower @entity76 ( no answer ) , how to combat @entity115 in @entity42 without favoring the @entity41 - dominated government and alienating @entity42 @entity118 ( no answer ) and how to backstop the @entity62 in @entity107 without enabling them to make matters worse through their airstrikes ( no answer )*****0
@entity3 has a much easier time managing contradictions*****0
indeed , it can use the threat of @entity115 to keep the @entity4 away from weakening their ally @entity76 as well as expand its influence in @entity42 under the guise of fighting a battle of mutual interest*****1
@entity131 naval assets to the @entity106 notwithstanding , the @entity4 is being outfoxed , not outgunned*****1
do n't expect @entity4 ships to stop those of @entity3*****1
as @entity134 spokesperson @entity133 said , " there are reports about these @entity4 ships that have been moved and i want to be very clear just so that no one has the wrong impression*****0
they are not there to intercept @entity3 ships*****0
the purpose of moving them is only to ensure that the shipping lanes remain open and safe*****0
i think there was some misreporting and confusion on this*****0
i just want to be very clear that the purpose is not to do anything in terms of those @entity3 ships*****0
" it clearly makes sense to try to use diplomacy as a way to constrain @entity3 's nuclear program*****1
but we should have no illusions about two things*****0
first , we wo n't end @entity11 's nuclear weapons pretensions , and two , we are and will be enabling its rise in the region because of this nuclear diplomacy , not constraining it*****0
one of the reasons the @entity4 wo n't strike @entity76 is for fear of emboldening @entity115 , but the other is that we do n't want a proxy war with @entity3 in @entity70*****1
as the @entity81 have made clear in their recent s - 300 deal , the nuclear negotiations are only making @entity3 a more acceptable business partner*****1
and the real fruits of the diplomacy have n't even begun yet*****0
sanctions relief will make the mullahs more secure and give them the resources to buck up , not tamp down , their regional aspirations*****0
we 've made our bed , apparently , and now are going to have to find a way to sleep*****0
a nuclear deal will avert a crisis over the nuclear issue for now*****0
but unless it really does change @entity3 's behavior , we 've only bought ourselves a bigger one down the road .*****0
