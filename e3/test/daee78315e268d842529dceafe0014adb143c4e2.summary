@entity3 ( @entity4 ) sending @entity2 bomber @entity1 to prison for the rest of his life would bring years of punishment and rob him of martyrdom , jurors were told monday . " we have seen more pain and more horror and more grief in this courtroom than any of you would have thought possible , " attorney @entity11 said as @entity1 's defense team began what could be a two - week campaign to avoid the death penalty . " no punishment could ever be equal to the terrible effects of this crime on the survivors and the victims ' families , " he said . " there is no evening of the scales . there is no point of trying to hurt him as he hurt because it ca n't be done . all we can do , all you can do is make the best choice . " @entity11 told jurors there are only two punishments for them to choose from : death , or life in prison without any possibility of parole . " we are asking you to punish @entity44 by imprisoning him for the rest of his life . " showing the court a photo of the federal @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity11 said : " this is where the government keeps other terrorists who used to be famous but are n't anymore . ... he goes here and he 's forgotten . no more spotlight , like the death penalty brings . " no interviews with the news media , no autobiography , no messages from @entity63 on the @entity64 . no nothing . " no martyrdom . just years and years of punishment , day after day , as he grows up to deal with the lonely struggle of dealing with what he did . " the evidence will show that if you sentence @entity44 to a lifetime of thinking about what he did , you 'll both punish him and protect society . " @entity1 , 21 , was convicted this month of all 30 counts against him ; 17 of those counts carry the death penalty for the murders of four -- @entity82 , 29 ; @entity83 , 23 ; @entity84 , 8 ; and @entity85 , 26 . in deciding whether the former college student is executed for his crimes or spends the rest of his days in a high - security federal prison , jurors must weigh the heinousness of his crime and the toll on his victims against so - called mitigating factors , such as his relative youth , mental health and family background , and whether or not he is remorseful . he has shown no emotion as he sits in court , and he has avoided eye contact with maimed bombing survivors and relatives of the dead . last week , federal prosecutors presented three days of gut - wrenching victim impact testimony , including an array of images showing the victims as happy , active people and edited videos that added a soundtrack featuring a loud explosion , screams and panicked voices to the horrific bombing scene outside the @entity116 , where @entity84 and @entity83 died . lead defense attorney @entity117 -- a nationally known death penalty opponent -- has acknowledged that @entity1 and his brother , @entity119 , set off the bombs and shot @entity121 campus cop @entity85 . but she is expected to build a narrative showing her client as a puppet of his dominant older brother . @entity126 , who was 26 , died in a gunbattle with @entity128 , @entity129 , police three days after the bombings . @entity133 's colleague , @entity11 , began that narrative in his opening statement by noting , " the man who conceived , planned and led this crime is beyond our power to punish . only the 19 - year - old younger brother who helped is left . " he was 19 , nearly 20 . but he was still at an age still legally too young to buy a beer . and an age when people make horribly bad , destructive decisions . what each of you will have to decide for yourself is how to weigh his young age as a mitigating factor . " @entity11 tried to use a photo prosecutors introduced last week -- showing @entity1 raising his middle finger at a surveillance camera in his federal courthouse cell -- to make his point . " i could almost hear you gasp " when that photo was displayed between images of bombing victims , @entity11 said . " it turned out that shocking gesture was n't quite as advertised . " what did he mean ? it meant he was acting as an immature 19 - year - old . " several members of @entity1 's family arrived in @entity3 over the weekend , but the defense is closely guarding its witness list . the relatives , who are at an undisclosed location after being forced to leave a suburban hotel , apparently do not include his parents , who divorced and returned to @entity172 before the april 15 , 2013 , bombings . court filings indicate that the defense plans to call expert witness @entity176 , a sociologist , to explain @entity1 's difficult upbringing as the overlooked child of immigrants -- displaced @entity181 @entity180 whose @entity183 dream failed . under federal law , the jury 's decision must be unanimous . a deadlocked jury would result in an automatic life sentence for @entity1 -- which means the defense only needs to convince one juror to spare his life . the @entity193 reported over the weekend that fewer than 20 % of those polled in @entity129 favor the death penalty for @entity1 . the number is down substantially since the days after the bombings .
