( @entity1 ) over the last few years , we 've been close to eradicating worldwide polio without full success . however , a new medical technology , an easily applied microneedle patch , could be the key to that goal . the biggest challenge standing in the way of eradicating polio has involved the operational logistics of getting the vaccine to people who need it , especially in difficult areas plagued by violence or poverty . the microneedle patch , which resembles a small , round adhesive bandage , could bring polio vaccines to the doorsteps of the people that need it . by applying it to the skin and pushing down , the vaccine is delivered in a matter of minutes . rather than requiring highly trained medics , minimally trained personnel could go from door to door , quickly administering the vaccine . it 's been 60 years since a mass inoculation of @entity35 's vaccine began with school children in april , 1955 that caused polio cases in the @entity38 to drop by almost 90 % over the course of two years . the vaccine was eagerly awaited because , according to the @entity42 , about 35,000 people annually became disabled because of polio in the @entity38 in the 1940s and ' 50s . in 1938 , @entity46 founded the @entity47 , an organization known today as the @entity47 , to fight polio . the organization funded the two vaccines -- one created by @entity35 and another by @entity50 -- that would lead to the protection of most of the world against polio . @entity35 's vaccine , developed in the 1950s , involved injecting a virus that was " killed , " while @entity50 's vaccine -- which he worked on in the 1960s and which was administered orally -- contained a weakened version of polio . the @entity50 vaccine actually helped boost immunity in communities beyond the individual because people shed the weakened virus in their feces . it came to replace the @entity35 in many places between 1963 and 1999 , according to the @entity70 . but the injected " killed " virus version is what 's given in the @entity38 today because of the rare instances of people developing polio from the oral vaccine . most people with polio have no symptoms ; minor symptoms such as limb pain , fatigue and nausea affect about 4 % to 8 % of patients , according to the @entity42 . fewer than 1 % of cases lead to patients becoming permanently paralyzed , usually in the legs . between 5 % and 10 % of paralyzed patients die when their respiratory muscles become paralyzed , too . human beings have been living with polio for thousands of years , dr. @entity90 , a polio specialist at the @entity42 , said . there 's evidence from ancient @entity95 that paralytic polio existed there and even infected royalty . but it was n't described clinically until 1789 . the @entity38 saw its first polio outbreak in 1894 in @entity100 , with 132 cases , according to the @entity70 . as the population became more urbanized in the early 20th century , more outbreaks occurred . president @entity46 contracted the disease at age 39 in 1921 . although no cure was developed , a device called an iron lung was invented to help people with the disease breathe . the patient would lie on a bed inside a cylindrical tank , and the machine helped some people become able to breathe again on their own . this device cost about $ 1,500 in the 1930s -- about what a home would cost then , according to the @entity70 . that is , until the vaccine came on the scene . @entity123 was declared eradicated in the @entity38 in 1979 . but the vaccination effort does n't stop .

( @entity1 ) over the last few years , we 've been close to eradicating worldwide polio without full success*****0
however , a new medical technology , an easily applied microneedle patch , could be the key to that goal*****1
the biggest challenge standing in the way of eradicating polio has involved the operational logistics of getting the vaccine to people who need it , especially in difficult areas plagued by violence or poverty*****0
the microneedle patch , which resembles a small , round adhesive bandage , could bring polio vaccines to the doorsteps of the people that need it*****1
by applying it to the skin and pushing down , the vaccine is delivered in a matter of minutes*****0
rather than requiring highly trained medics , minimally trained personnel could go from door to door , quickly administering the vaccine*****1
it 's been 60 years since a mass inoculation of @entity35 's vaccine began with school children in april , 1955 that caused polio cases in the @entity38 to drop by almost 90 % over the course of two years*****1
the vaccine was eagerly awaited because , according to the @entity42 , about 35,000 people annually became disabled because of polio in the @entity38 in the 1940s and ' 50s*****1
in 1938 , @entity46 founded the @entity47 , an organization known today as the @entity47 , to fight polio*****0
the organization funded the two vaccines -- one created by @entity35 and another by @entity50 -- that would lead to the protection of most of the world against polio*****0
@entity35 's vaccine , developed in the 1950s , involved injecting a virus that was " killed , " while @entity50 's vaccine -- which he worked on in the 1960s and which was administered orally -- contained a weakened version of polio*****1
the @entity50 vaccine actually helped boost immunity in communities beyond the individual because people shed the weakened virus in their feces*****0
it came to replace the @entity35 in many places between 1963 and 1999 , according to the @entity70*****0
but the injected " killed " virus version is what 's given in the @entity38 today because of the rare instances of people developing polio from the oral vaccine*****1
most people with polio have no symptoms ; minor symptoms such as limb pain , fatigue and nausea affect about 4 % to 8 % of patients , according to the @entity42*****0
fewer than 1 % of cases lead to patients becoming permanently paralyzed , usually in the legs*****0
between 5 % and 10 % of paralyzed patients die when their respiratory muscles become paralyzed , too*****0
human beings have been living with polio for thousands of years , dr. @entity90 , a polio specialist at the @entity42 , said*****0
there 's evidence from ancient @entity95 that paralytic polio existed there and even infected royalty*****0
but it was n't described clinically until 1789*****0
the @entity38 saw its first polio outbreak in 1894 in @entity100 , with 132 cases , according to the @entity70*****0
as the population became more urbanized in the early 20th century , more outbreaks occurred*****0
president @entity46 contracted the disease at age 39 in 1921*****0
although no cure was developed , a device called an iron lung was invented to help people with the disease breathe*****0
the patient would lie on a bed inside a cylindrical tank , and the machine helped some people become able to breathe again on their own*****0
this device cost about $ 1,500 in the 1930s -- about what a home would cost then , according to the @entity70*****0
that is , until the vaccine came on the scene*****0
@entity123 was declared eradicated in the @entity38 in 1979*****1
but the vaccination effort does n't stop*****0
" in the @entity38 , where there 's no problem anymore , we still want to have the population protected , " said @entity125 , senior advisor and interim medical director of the @entity47*****1
children should receive four doses of inactivated polio vaccine , delivered as an injection , at ages 2 months , 4 months , 6 to 18 months , and 4 to 6 years , according to the @entity42*****1
most @entity38 adults were vaccinated as children and do n't need another dose*****1
but people may need additional protection if they are traveling to high - risk countries , handle poliovirus specimens in a laboratory or have close contact with a person who has polio*****0
polio primarily spreads from person to person -- through coughing and sneezing -- or through fecal contamination*****0
the particles are large enough that the risk of contracting polio in the air is momentary , and on a surface like a desk or a chair , it can last an hour or two*****0
but in sewage , it can last for weeks or even months*****0
polio is the next likely candidate for disease eradication , @entity90 said*****0
the only infectious disease that humans have eradicated is smallpox*****0
like polio , it was a viral disease spread from person to person and would infect everyone in the absence of vaccination*****0
and there 's no non-human animal in nature that hosts these viruses , making it easier to eradicate than a disease that animals carry , too ( although at least 100,000 monkeys were killed in the development of polio vaccines in the mid- 20th century , according to the @entity70 )*****0
a big difference , though , is that smallpox has obvious characteristic symptoms : fever and rash*****0
most people with polio have no symptoms at all , or very mild symptoms*****0
on average , one out of 200 patients experiences paralysis*****0
for polio , tremendous progress is being made , with 95 % of children being reached for the most part , @entity193 , spokesman for polio efforts at the @entity195 , said*****0
but there are still districts where only 75 % to 80 % of children are covered , which allows the virus to continue circulating in @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205*****0
" the virus keeps getting increasingly restricted , " @entity193 said*****0
" we 're not there , but i think the trend is good*****0
" perhaps microneedles could be the key to finally eradicate worldwide polio .*****0
