( @entity1 ) we 're 2 degrees from a different world*****1
humans never have lived on a planet that 's 2 degrees @entity6 ) warmer than it was before we started burning fossil fuels , in the late 1800s , and climate experts say we risk fundamentally changing life on this planet if we do cross that 2 - degree mark*****1
" this is gambling with the planet , " said @entity13 , the lead senior economist at the @entity14 and co-author of the book " @entity17*****0
" think super droughts , rising seas and mass extinctions*****0
yet for all of its importance , i do n't think the 2 - degree threshold is as famous as it should be*****0
i 've heard it referred to as the " north star " for climate negotiations*****0
meaning : this one little number carries huge importance as a way to focus the world 's attention*****1
it 's so significant that it 's going to be the subject of my reporting for the rest of the year*****1
i 'm calling that effort " 2 degrees , " and i need your help to make it work*****1
until 5 p.m. et monday , you can vote on the first story i 'll report for the series*****0
vote using the @entity47 poll below ( or go here if you do n't see it*****0
) tell @entity1 's @entity49 which of these climate change stories you like best - and he 'll report on the winner*****1
this poll closes monday , april 27 , at 5pm et. # 2degrees all of those story ideas came from you , by the way*****0
they focus on what a 2 - degree world might look like*****1
@entity1 kicked off this effort with a @entity47 chat last week*****0
we asked for your questions about climate change and about the 2 - degree threshold , specifically*****0
i do n't have all the answers right now*****0
we 'll continue to explore the importance of this number together*****0
but below you 'll find quick responses to seven basic questions about this crucial number*****0
many of them come straight from you , the readers*****0
and i tossed in a couple of my own*****0
if you 'd like to follow this project as it evolves , i 'd encourage you to sign up for the " 2 degrees " newsletter*****1
and feel free to ask more questions in the comments section below*****0
they 'll shape the way i spend the rest of the year reporting on this super-critical number*****0
one guy , it turns out*****0
@entity90 , an economist at @entity91*****0
@entity90 , 73 , proposed the 2 - degree threshold in a 1977 ( 1977 ! ) paper titled " economic growth and climate : the @entity95*****0
" the estimate was " crude , but it was a reasonable first start , " he told me*****0

later came the @entity134 , the @entity135 , the @entity136 and , most significantly , the @entity137 , which was signed by more than 100 nations who agreed 2 degrees would be too much*****1
the @entity140 was among the signatories*****0
i 'm going to spend the month of may exploring this question , so look for more on this*****0
but here are some striking facts about what scientists expect a post- 2 - degree world to look like*****1
these are pulled from reports by the @entity151 , the @entity152 and the @entity153*****0
wildfires in the @entity140 are expected to increase 400 % to 800 % in size*****0
hurricanes are expected to become 2 % to 8 % more intense*****0
a range of species will be at risk for extinction , particularly amphibians*****0
the @entity152 estimates 20 % to 30 % of animals and plants species will be at " increasingly high risk of extinction " at or near the 2 - degree mark*****0
the @entity166 is expected keep melting , losing 30 % of its annual average sea ice*****0
certain crop yields in the @entity140 , @entity171 and @entity172 are expected to decrease 10 % to 30 %*****0
the availability of freshwater is expected to decline by 20 %*****0
so ... not good*****0
