( @entity2 ) @entity1 prime minister @entity0 is scheduled to speak wednesday to a joint meeting of @entity4 . the address marks the first time in history that the head of the @entity1 government will address the entire @entity4 , and given the importance of the @entity13 - @entity1 relationship , it is an invitation long overdue . so far , prime minister @entity0 's appearance has garnered much less attention than last month 's speech to @entity4 by @entity19 prime minister @entity18 . this is not surprising ; in a recent survey by the @entity23 nearly three - quarters of the respondents indicated they had " never heard of " @entity0 , underscoring just how difficult it is for the @entity26 administration to sell its much - vaunted " pivot " or " rebalance " to the @entity13 public . nevertheless , @entity0 arrives in @entity29 at an opportune time to help along the economic centerpiece of the " pivot , " the @entity34 , or @entity33 . the @entity33 is a potentially massive free trade agreement involving the @entity13 , @entity1 and 10 other @entity38 - facing nations -- combined , these countries account for 40 % of global gdp . and beyond its potential economic impact , it also allows the @entity13 to expand its influence in @entity43 , providing an alternative to @entity46 - centered agreements such as the @entity47 . the stakes , therefore , are significant . but so is some of the opposition to an agreement that has been negotiated in secret . prominent @entity53 such as @entity55 sen. @entity54 and @entity57 sen. @entity56 , for example , have been critical of the @entity33 , arguing that provisions such as one on international arbitration of disputes between investors and states undermine @entity13 sovereignty . but the immediate battle in @entity4 is not over the @entity33 directly , but something called trade promotion authority , or " @entity68 . " trade promotion authority , which would allow trade agreements such as the @entity33 to come before @entity4 without amendment , has been on the books for decades . the power to use trade promotion authority , however , must be periodically reauthorized . @entity4 voted narrowly to give president @entity75 trade promotion authority in 2002 , but that authority expired in 2007 and has not been renewed . there is near universal agreement that the current talks can not be concluded unless the @entity4 reauthorizes trade promotion authority , without which the 11 other nations that are parties to the talks can not be confident that the @entity13 speaks with one voice . @entity86 control both houses of @entity4 , and are generally supportive of free trade . but while passage of trade promotion authority in the @entity93 is likely , the result in the @entity90 , where @entity0 will be speaking , is less certain . this is in part because some @entity90 @entity86 are simply loath to delegate any power to the president , while others are certainly aware of the ramifications of the trade promotion authority vote for 2016 . after all , the fact that @entity86 would actually be supporting the proposal of a @entity53 president will not prevent @entity53 -- and their labor supporters -- from using the vote as a weapon to diminish support for @entity86 among those white , working - class voters who were so crucial to @entity86 success in the 2014 midterm . but even if trade promotion authority passes , the fight over the @entity33 is far from over . provisions in the trade promotion authority bills just voted out of the committees will require review for at least four months after the negotiations are concluded and before @entity4 can grant final approval to the @entity33 . this likely throws the @entity33 vote directly into the path of the 2016 presidential race . ironically , the fact that @entity53 seem likely to nominate @entity125 , an early supporter of the @entity33 , may go a long way to blunting this attack . still , it is hard to see @entity129 willing to " go it alone " on the @entity33 without some @entity53 buy - in . which brings us back to prime minister @entity0 's speech . given that we are fast approaching the 70th anniversary of the end of @entity138 , there will be an understandable focus on what the prime minister says regarding his nation 's role in that conflict . in the eyes of many in @entity46 and @entity147 , @entity1 has never sufficiently apologized for its past transgressions , while the @entity13 itself expressed disappointment over a visit @entity0 made to the controversial @entity152 . yet despite such criticisms , a @entity23 poll found a plurality in the @entity13 thinks that the apologies that @entity1 has issued in the past about the war are sufficient . as a result , for much of the @entity13 audience , @entity0 's words about the @entity33 will be of equal importance to questions of history . so , what will the prime minister say , and will his support for @entity33 be enough to sway @entity4 ? certainly , @entity0 has a lot riding on the agreement domestically ; he has faced opposition from agricultural interests at home who are usually firm backers of his ruling @entity174 , and could be hurt politically if the negotiations collapse . this suggests that the big challenge for @entity0 on wednesday will be to reframe the debate over trade promotion authority and the @entity33 in a way that convinces the @entity13 people that the trade agreement is not about enriching @entity13 corporations and outsourcing @entity13 jobs , but strengthening the @entity13 - @entity1 alliance and establishing trade rules that will eventually help the @entity13 and other countries combat the unfair trade practices of @entity46 . it 's a tall task , especially when it is unlikely the public will be paying much attention to his speech . but it 's a deal that will have significant repercussions not just for the deal at hand , but for the success of president @entity26 's pivot to @entity43 . and with that in mind , prime minister @entity0 wo n't be the only one hoping he can turn in a convincing performance on wednesday .

( @entity2 ) @entity1 prime minister @entity0 is scheduled to speak wednesday to a joint meeting of @entity4*****1
the address marks the first time in history that the head of the @entity1 government will address the entire @entity4 , and given the importance of the @entity13 - @entity1 relationship , it is an invitation long overdue*****1
so far , prime minister @entity0 's appearance has garnered much less attention than last month 's speech to @entity4 by @entity19 prime minister @entity18*****1
this is not surprising ; in a recent survey by the @entity23 nearly three - quarters of the respondents indicated they had " never heard of " @entity0 , underscoring just how difficult it is for the @entity26 administration to sell its much - vaunted " pivot " or " rebalance " to the @entity13 public*****0
nevertheless , @entity0 arrives in @entity29 at an opportune time to help along the economic centerpiece of the " pivot , " the @entity34 , or @entity33*****1
the @entity33 is a potentially massive free trade agreement involving the @entity13 , @entity1 and 10 other @entity38 - facing nations -- combined , these countries account for 40 % of global gdp*****1
and beyond its potential economic impact , it also allows the @entity13 to expand its influence in @entity43 , providing an alternative to @entity46 - centered agreements such as the @entity47*****0
the stakes , therefore , are significant*****0
but so is some of the opposition to an agreement that has been negotiated in secret*****0
prominent @entity53 such as @entity55 sen. @entity54 and @entity57 sen. @entity56 , for example , have been critical of the @entity33 , arguing that provisions such as one on international arbitration of disputes between investors and states undermine @entity13 sovereignty*****0
but the immediate battle in @entity4 is not over the @entity33 directly , but something called trade promotion authority , or " @entity68*****1
" trade promotion authority , which would allow trade agreements such as the @entity33 to come before @entity4 without amendment , has been on the books for decades*****1
the power to use trade promotion authority , however , must be periodically reauthorized*****0
@entity4 voted narrowly to give president @entity75 trade promotion authority in 2002 , but that authority expired in 2007 and has not been renewed*****1
there is near universal agreement that the current talks can not be concluded unless the @entity4 reauthorizes trade promotion authority , without which the 11 other nations that are parties to the talks can not be confident that the @entity13 speaks with one voice*****1
@entity86 control both houses of @entity4 , and are generally supportive of free trade*****1
but while passage of trade promotion authority in the @entity93 is likely , the result in the @entity90 , where @entity0 will be speaking , is less certain*****1
this is in part because some @entity90 @entity86 are simply loath to delegate any power to the president , while others are certainly aware of the ramifications of the trade promotion authority vote for 2016*****0
after all , the fact that @entity86 would actually be supporting the proposal of a @entity53 president will not prevent @entity53 -- and their labor supporters -- from using the vote as a weapon to diminish support for @entity86 among those white , working - class voters who were so crucial to @entity86 success in the 2014 midterm*****0
but even if trade promotion authority passes , the fight over the @entity33 is far from over*****1
provisions in the trade promotion authority bills just voted out of the committees will require review for at least four months after the negotiations are concluded and before @entity4 can grant final approval to the @entity33*****1
this likely throws the @entity33 vote directly into the path of the 2016 presidential race*****0
ironically , the fact that @entity53 seem likely to nominate @entity125 , an early supporter of the @entity33 , may go a long way to blunting this attack*****0
still , it is hard to see @entity129 willing to " go it alone " on the @entity33 without some @entity53 buy - in*****0
which brings us back to prime minister @entity0 's speech*****0
given that we are fast approaching the 70th anniversary of the end of @entity138 , there will be an understandable focus on what the prime minister says regarding his nation 's role in that conflict*****0
in the eyes of many in @entity46 and @entity147 , @entity1 has never sufficiently apologized for its past transgressions , while the @entity13 itself expressed disappointment over a visit @entity0 made to the controversial @entity152*****1
yet despite such criticisms , a @entity23 poll found a plurality in the @entity13 thinks that the apologies that @entity1 has issued in the past about the war are sufficient*****0
as a result , for much of the @entity13 audience , @entity0 's words about the @entity33 will be of equal importance to questions of history*****1
so , what will the prime minister say , and will his support for @entity33 be enough to sway @entity4 ? certainly , @entity0 has a lot riding on the agreement domestically ; he has faced opposition from agricultural interests at home who are usually firm backers of his ruling @entity174 , and could be hurt politically if the negotiations collapse*****1
this suggests that the big challenge for @entity0 on wednesday will be to reframe the debate over trade promotion authority and the @entity33 in a way that convinces the @entity13 people that the trade agreement is not about enriching @entity13 corporations and outsourcing @entity13 jobs , but strengthening the @entity13 - @entity1 alliance and establishing trade rules that will eventually help the @entity13 and other countries combat the unfair trade practices of @entity46*****1
it 's a tall task , especially when it is unlikely the public will be paying much attention to his speech*****0
but it 's a deal that will have significant repercussions not just for the deal at hand , but for the success of president @entity26 's pivot to @entity43*****0
and with that in mind , prime minister @entity0 wo n't be the only one hoping he can turn in a convincing performance on wednesday .*****0
