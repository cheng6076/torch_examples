but there is as yet little sign that the rebels are being driven back , that the fighting in @entity5 is dying down or that lives there are being saved*****0
to the contrary , increasingly more @entity5 appear to be fleeing the country , attempting the dangerous trip in rickety fishing boats across the @entity15 to the @entity16 -- a trip historically made by people fleeing @entity19 rather than the other way around*****0
hopes for stability , not only in @entity5 but in the @entity23 in general , are fading as fears grow that @entity1 and @entity25 are fighting a proxy war in @entity5 for regional domination*****0
and the number of dead continues to mount*****0
@entity5 's health ministry said over the weekend that 385 civilians had been killed and 342 others had been wounded*****0
the @entity33 has put a higher figure on both tolls -- 648 killed and 2,191 wounded -- but includes militant casualties in the totals*****1
the @entity4 forced @entity5 president @entity38 from power in january , though @entity38 still claims he is @entity5 's legitimate leader and is working with the @entity1 and other allies to return to @entity5*****1
those allied with @entity38 have accused the @entity25 government of supporting the @entity4 in their uprising in @entity5*****0
like the @entity25 , the @entity4 are @entity44*****0
and like the @entity1 , @entity38 and his government are @entity46*****0
since it began on march 26 , @entity1 has launched more than 1,200 airstrikes*****0
@entity1 officials claim to have killed more than 500 @entity4 rebels*****1
the @entity50 voted tuesday in favor of an arms embargo on @entity4 -- the minority group that has taken over large swaths of @entity5 , including its capital , @entity56 -- and supporters of former @entity5 president @entity58*****1
the resolution " raises the cost " for the @entity4 , according to @entity61 , @entity62 's ambassador to the @entity63*****0
in addition to the arms embargo , the resolution also demands that the @entity44 group pull back and refrain from more violence and includes sanctions aimed at controlling the spread of terrorism , according to @entity61*****1
