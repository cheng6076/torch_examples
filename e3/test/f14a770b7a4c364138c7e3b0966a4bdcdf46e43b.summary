@entity1 ( @entity2 ) when the bomb went off , @entity0 thought he was still standing . that was because , as he lay on the ground , he was still holding the handles of his son 's stroller . he pulled back the stroller 's cover and saw that his son , @entity11 , 3 , was conscious but bleeding from the left side of his head . @entity0 checked @entity11 for other injuries and thought , " let 's get out of here . " that was before he noticed his @entity18 , which resembled transparent tape covered in blood , and his left tibia protruding from his boot . the boot was next to his left stump , he testified before a federal jury thursday , the third day in which survivors and family members of those killed in the @entity28 shared their stories -- often gruesome and heartbreaking -- in the sentencing phase for @entity32 . the prosecution rested thursday afternoon after attempting to convince jurors that @entity32 was cold - hearted and remorseless . the defense , led by famed death penalty opponent @entity36 , is expected to try to soften that portrayal by calling witnesses to explain @entity32 's difficult upbringing . @entity41 will begin those efforts monday . a group of @entity32 's relatives arrived at @entity1 's @entity45 on thursday , @entity2 affiliate @entity46 reported , but it 's not clear if they plan to testify . the jury must decide whether the 21 - year - old , who has been found guilty of perpetrating the attack with his now - deceased brother , will die for his crimes or spend his life in prison . @entity0 , a biomedical researcher for the @entity54 , recalled using his belt as a tourniquet on his leg and trying to comfort @entity11 . the boy cried , " @entity59 ! daddy ! mommy ! daddy ! mommy ! daddy ! mommy ! daddy ! " he testified . amid the stench of " burning hair , blood , sulfur , " a good @entity67 emerged . he gave @entity0 another tourniquet and rushed @entity11 to safety .

" i looked across the patients and i knew immediately , without anyone having to tell me , exactly what the wounding mechanism was . " @entity97 had no such experience , so when one of the two bombs exploded , sending her through the doors of a restaurant and into a " puddle of chaos and blood and glass , " her instinct was to run . but she could n't . her foot felt like it was on fire , she testified . two women helped her as she overheard someone saying a @entity112 . she called for her husband . he picked her up and carried her out of the restaurant . " i saw blood pouring out of my foot , " she said . she finally got to a hospital , and after three attempts to save her foot , which was missing its entire heel , a doctor told her she had a decision : she could keep her leg and risk a life of excruciating pain or have it amputated below the knee . she chose the latter . " it was probably the hardest decision i 've had to make , " she testified . another marathon attendee rendered an amputee by the @entity32 brothers ' attack , @entity133 , recounted the two bombs going off . " i stepped back , and the next thing i remember was looking up at the sky , " he testified , adding that he remembered " a lot of yelling , a lot of screaming , people crying out for tourniquets .

" so where the prosthetic attaches on your butt , it rubs and breaks down and creates open wounds , " he said . and though his left leg survived , it was severely burned , his calf muscle was blown off and his heel was shattered , he said . he hopes to save the left leg , he testified , but it 's likely that it will have to be amputated above the knee . he takes more than 70 pills -- 24 pills in morning , 22 in afternoon , 26 at night -- to cope with his injuries , he said . one of the most dramatic points in thursday 's testimony involved the death of young @entity184 . the prosecution showed close - up video of the 8 - year - old , who was only 3Â½ feet from one of the bombs , according to the @entity192 's re-creation of the crime scene . his parents , @entity196 and @entity197 , are opposed to @entity32 receiving the death penalty and did not participate in the penalty phase , though @entity200 did testify during the guilt phase . dr. @entity78 told the court that @entity184 was especially vulnerable to the blast because he was so small and close to the ground , meaning the shrapnel more easily reached his head and torso . it 's highly unlikely the boy died instantly , @entity78 said . explaining that @entity184 died of rapid blood loss , @entity78 testified , " receptors are generally not responsive to cutting . if you happen to be awake and someone cuts your bowel or liver , it generally does not hurt . what hurts is the stretching and twisting . ... intestines were pulled and twisted ; that would have caused visceral type pain .
