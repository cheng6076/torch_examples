( @entity1 ) it sounds like the plot for a science fiction movie . someone has a horrific accident and winds up in the hospital , brain dead and on life support . doctors approach the family about organ donation , but instead of saving as many as eight lives , the family is asked to donate the whole body to save just one individual . perhaps a quadriplegic with a mind that outmatches their malfunctioning body . as crazy as this sounds , to put an entire head on a new body , a human body , @entity25 physician dr. @entity24 says we are approaching @entity27 ( an acronym for head anastomosis venture ; anastomosis is surgically connecting two parts ) . the pieces are coming together but there are still many hurdles to jump . @entity24 says he has part of the funding secured , although he says he ca n't yet disclose where the money is coming from as a condition of the funding . he 's also taking the 2015 layman 's approach with crowd funding and book sales . he has identified @entity45 as the first patient . the 30 - year - old @entity48 man suffers from a rare genetic disorder called @entity51 disease . @entity24 says the man volunteered . the two men have talked via @entity54 but they have yet to meet in person and @entity24 has not reviewed @entity45 's medical records . @entity24 says he has a stack of emails and letters from people who want this procedure . many of them are transsexuals who want a new body , he says . but he insists the first patients will be people who are suffering from a muscle wasting disease . another big obstacle is the need for a partner . @entity24 ca n't just do this in his own @entity72 lab. he needs a major academic medical center to host this endeavor and he has his eyes set on the @entity76 . he hopes to get a buy - in this summer when he presents his plan to the @entity78 , or @entity79 , at its annual conference in june . he 's counting on getting the green light he needs for the first human whole head transplant to take place in 2017 . @entity84 , executive director of @entity79 , says the group is not endorsing @entity24 , it is simply giving him a platform to hear what he has to say . if @entity24 does n't get the support he needs in the @entity76 , he 'll look to @entity89 and his timeline will slide by a year . once these pieces are in place , @entity24 says he 'll put together a staff of 150 nurses and doctors . many of them , like the patient , are already identified because they 've asked to be part of this team . then they 'll need to practice for what is anticipated to be a 36 - hour operation . " i say two years is the time needed for the team to reach perfect synchronization , " @entity24 speculates . but what about the science ? is such an idea even plausible ? he says he has research that supports it . @entity24 points to dr. @entity112 , who transplanted the head of one monkey to the body of another at @entity117 in 1970 . the monkey died after eight days , because the body rejected the new head . before ithe monkey died , it could not move because the spinal cord of the head and body were not connected . the monkey also was unable to breathe on its own . the paper in which @entity24 outlined his procedure references a different 1971 experiment @entity112 conducted with six monkey heads , none of which survived more than 24 hours . but @entity24 says advances in science and medicine since then eliminate the problems @entity112 faced . dr. @entity137 , chairman of neurological surgery at @entity139 and president - elect of the @entity141 , says @entity112 's research is not validation for a human head transplant . " [ it 's ] a 45 - year - old reference in a primate and there is no evidence that the spinal cord was anastomosed functionally , " he says . @entity137 further explains that it 's a great leap to go from brain survival of the surgery to restoring body function , which @entity112 did not look at . @entity24 is confident in his writing and in conversation . he cites @entity112 's monkeys and even the success of @entity159 researchers who helped paralyzed rats walk , giving no pause to the fact that such research is more likely to go nowhere than to make it to human clinical trials . he published his paper in the free , online , medical journal @entity169 in 2013 . he walks readers through a scenario , outlining the key points that will make this work , including cooling the spinal cord before severing it . doing so with an ultra-sharp blade will avoid the damage experienced by spinal cord injury patients , he says . he 'll use a " magic ingredient " as a sealant to fuse the spinal cord back together and offers a few options for what that ingredient could be . the nerves , having been color - coded when separated , will be carefully aligned and this will all be done very quickly because time is key . an impossibility , according to @entity137 . he conceded that the airway , the spine , the major veins and arteries , can all be put back together , but the spinal cord is the problem . he says the result would be the inability to move or breathe . " i would not wish this on anyone , i would not allow anyone to do it to me , there are a lot of things worse than death , " @entity137 says . the science is n't there to support this , says @entity208 , ph.d. , director of medical ethics at @entity211 . he says it 's nothing more than a big pr stunt , and calls @entity24 " nuts . " @entity208 says this has to be done in many animals before it 's tried on humans . @entity208 also points out that if @entity24 can do this , he should first be helping paralyzed patients by fixing their spinal cords , before transplanting whole bodies . as for the patients , @entity208 says , " their bodies would end up being overwhelmed with different pathways and chemistry than they are used to and they 'd go crazy . " in his paper , @entity24 says identity issues could be a problem as the head gets used to its new body . he also says pain could be a problem . as far as immunosuppression , @entity24 points to today 's transplant successes as evidence this is not a problem . @entity208 is n't buying it . he 's seen how difficult it is for his @entity211 colleagues who perform face transplants . the levels of anti-rejection medications required are so high they put patients at risk for cancer and kidney problems . he says it does n't make sense that you 'd poison a new body with immunosuppressant medications to make a head transplant work . another issue @entity208 has seen with face transplant patients is they do n't always get full function of their new organ . " it 's not like you can unscrew your head and put it on someone else , " @entity208 says . dr. @entity265 , the @entity266 national director for neurology , calls it farfetched and farcical , not to mention unlikely to work . he says this is more like centuries away , not years . " it would be impossible to predict that far into the future , " @entity265 says . @entity24 insists , though , " we can already do this . "
