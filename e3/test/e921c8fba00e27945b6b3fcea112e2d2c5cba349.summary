( @entity1 ) it 's easy to be anxious about the threat posed by the @entity3 . after all , this is a brutal organization that not only kills but seems to revel in doing so in ways designed to shock the world -- from the beheadings of journalists to burning a @entity11 pilot alive . such moves are part of this murky group 's propaganda and its deliberate efforts to manipulate information . so what can and should we make of the organization ? i explore the issue in depth in a special airing sunday night . and although it 's important to start with the caveat that @entity3 is indeed trying to scare and confuse us , i took away some tentative lessons from speaking with the people who have traveled inside the minds of @entity3 . first , @entity3 is clearly about religion -- its version of radical @entity33 -- but it is also about power . there is increasing evidence that the military backbone of @entity3 is made up not by a group of @entity3 zealots , but rather high - ranking officers from @entity43 's army -- baathists who were at least ostensibly secular . an internal @entity3 report detailing its organizational structure was reported on last week in the @entity49 weekly @entity48 . that report describes a group that uses its religious ideology as a recruiting and governing philosophy , much like communism . but underneath it , much like communism , is simply a drive for control , a lust for power . next , @entity3 presents itself as a global organization , but it has thrived because of a local cause . the group has gained territory , cash and recruits primarily because of the rage and rebellion of the @entity68 of @entity69 and @entity70 , who believe they must fight the @entity71 to secure their own survival and strength . the reality is that that @entity68 cause is going to endure for some time . the @entity76 has been successful in its tactical battles against @entity3 and has managed to push the group back from many of its gains in @entity69 . but the @entity68 of the region will remain in rebellion and the @entity68 - dominated areas will remain in turmoil -- chaos that @entity3 will be able to capitalize on this chaos . in the long run , @entity3 might very well find that its greatest foes lie within its so - called caliphate . the few reports that are emerging from areas controlled by @entity3 suggest that , unsurprisingly , people do not like living under a brutal , theocratic dictatorship . they live in fear , and even those who chose it as an alternative to @entity71 rule are growing disenchanted . in this respect , @entity3 is like other radical @entity3 groups , such as the @entity102 -- they have an allure in the abstract , but once they are actually governing in their medieval , barbarous manner , the allure fades and the disenchantment builds . the result is ever - increasing repression . remember , no one has ever voted isis into power anywhere . the group simply slaughters its way to control . of course , one of the big questions has been : is @entity3 a threat to the @entity116 ? the group 's leaders declare that it is . but their ambitions appear to be mostly centered on their @entity121 enemies , on building a caliphate in @entity69 and @entity70 . they understand , of course , that to be @entity127 no. 1 , they must battle the country that is the world 's no. 1 power -- the @entity76 . with that in mind , they seek such a confrontation and hope that the @entity76 will come to the @entity135 and fight them on their terms , on their terrain . still , while they are opportunists , and they ask and hope that their followers act in @entity76 , their main focus is not to come here -- they want @entity76 to go there . yet no matter how one rates the level of the threat @entity3 poses , the group has changed the nature of terror . the leaders of @entity3 have recognized that above all , they are a messaging machine , which in turn becomes a recruitment machine . this means that the key is not what happens on the ground , but on the airwaves and in the bits and bytes of the @entity162 . and @entity3 does this better than anyone before them because while their gruesome videos would seem a repulsive turn - off -- and are to most -- they still work on the web . the shock and awe they produce makes them go viral , and thus are seen by tens of millions . that ensures that these videos attract those utterly alienated young men -- a few thousand among the world 's 1.6 billion @entity177 -- who seek revenge , glory and gore . unfortunately , as long as those young @entity177 men , scattered across the globe , are attracted to @entity3 and stream to its cause , the group presents the world with a danger that is impossible to fully assess but is one that grows by the month .

( @entity1 ) it 's easy to be anxious about the threat posed by the @entity3*****0
after all , this is a brutal organization that not only kills but seems to revel in doing so in ways designed to shock the world -- from the beheadings of journalists to burning a @entity11 pilot alive*****0
such moves are part of this murky group 's propaganda and its deliberate efforts to manipulate information*****0
so what can and should we make of the organization ? i explore the issue in depth in a special airing sunday night*****0
and although it 's important to start with the caveat that @entity3 is indeed trying to scare and confuse us , i took away some tentative lessons from speaking with the people who have traveled inside the minds of @entity3*****0
first , @entity3 is clearly about religion -- its version of radical @entity33 -- but it is also about power*****0
there is increasing evidence that the military backbone of @entity3 is made up not by a group of @entity3 zealots , but rather high - ranking officers from @entity43 's army -- baathists who were at least ostensibly secular*****0
an internal @entity3 report detailing its organizational structure was reported on last week in the @entity49 weekly @entity48*****0
that report describes a group that uses its religious ideology as a recruiting and governing philosophy , much like communism*****0
but underneath it , much like communism , is simply a drive for control , a lust for power*****0
next , @entity3 presents itself as a global organization , but it has thrived because of a local cause*****1
the group has gained territory , cash and recruits primarily because of the rage and rebellion of the @entity68 of @entity69 and @entity70 , who believe they must fight the @entity71 to secure their own survival and strength*****1
the reality is that that @entity68 cause is going to endure for some time*****0
the @entity76 has been successful in its tactical battles against @entity3 and has managed to push the group back from many of its gains in @entity69*****1
but the @entity68 of the region will remain in rebellion and the @entity68 - dominated areas will remain in turmoil -- chaos that @entity3 will be able to capitalize on this chaos*****1
in the long run , @entity3 might very well find that its greatest foes lie within its so - called caliphate*****0
the few reports that are emerging from areas controlled by @entity3 suggest that , unsurprisingly , people do not like living under a brutal , theocratic dictatorship*****0
they live in fear , and even those who chose it as an alternative to @entity71 rule are growing disenchanted*****0
in this respect , @entity3 is like other radical @entity3 groups , such as the @entity102 -- they have an allure in the abstract , but once they are actually governing in their medieval , barbarous manner , the allure fades and the disenchantment builds*****0
the result is ever - increasing repression*****0
remember , no one has ever voted isis into power anywhere*****0
the group simply slaughters its way to control*****0
of course , one of the big questions has been : is @entity3 a threat to the @entity116 ? the group 's leaders declare that it is*****0
but their ambitions appear to be mostly centered on their @entity121 enemies , on building a caliphate in @entity69 and @entity70*****1
they understand , of course , that to be @entity127 no. 1 , they must battle the country that is the world 's no. 1 power -- the @entity76*****0
with that in mind , they seek such a confrontation and hope that the @entity76 will come to the @entity135 and fight them on their terms , on their terrain*****0
still , while they are opportunists , and they ask and hope that their followers act in @entity76 , their main focus is not to come here -- they want @entity76 to go there*****0
yet no matter how one rates the level of the threat @entity3 poses , the group has changed the nature of terror*****0
the leaders of @entity3 have recognized that above all , they are a messaging machine , which in turn becomes a recruitment machine*****1
this means that the key is not what happens on the ground , but on the airwaves and in the bits and bytes of the @entity162*****0
and @entity3 does this better than anyone before them because while their gruesome videos would seem a repulsive turn - off -- and are to most -- they still work on the web*****0
the shock and awe they produce makes them go viral , and thus are seen by tens of millions*****0
that ensures that these videos attract those utterly alienated young men -- a few thousand among the world 's 1.6 billion @entity177 -- who seek revenge , glory and gore*****0
unfortunately , as long as those young @entity177 men , scattered across the globe , are attracted to @entity3 and stream to its cause , the group presents the world with a danger that is impossible to fully assess but is one that grows by the month .*****0
