@entity0 ( @entity1 ) many australians are understandably appalled by the brutal and pointless executions of @entity4 and @entity5 . the death penalty looks anachronistic and ineffective at the best of times , but to kill two people who had clearly made the most of their long periods of incarceration to transform themselves and make amends for their actions looks gratuitous and cruel . consequently , @entity15 's actions raise more general questions about the powers we give to states -- or , more accurately , to those who control the coercive apparatus of the state at any particular moment . as @entity28 sociologist @entity27 pointed out , one of the key features of an effective state is that it has a monopoly over the legitimate use of violence . state officials can order people to be killed because -- especially in democracies -- we authorize them to do so . we can give no more significant power to another human being than to decide who lives or who dies . and yet even where that authority is deemed legitimate -- as is clearly the case in @entity15 -- its significance is only seriously considered at moments like this , when the very personal circumstances of some of its victims become the stuff of popular commentary and media interest . less prominent victims of state - sanctioned violence often go entirely unremarked . however disappointed we may be in the actions of @entity15 president @entity56 -- in whom so many inside and outside @entity15 have invested such hopes as a progressive force -- he can make a couple of claims in his defense . first , @entity62 -- popularly known as @entity56 -- is @entity15 's elected leader and is fulfilling his promise to crack down on what he and many other @entity15 see as a problem . @entity15 's domestic political context and the need to be seen as not giving favorable treatment to foreigners left him very little room to maneuver . this is not a justification for his actions , but it helps to explain why he was so impervious to pleas for mercy . whatever we may think about the underlying principles and administration of justice in @entity15 , at least @entity56 can claim that it is essentially a domestic issue . we may not like @entity15 's laws , but they are being applied even - handedly within national borders where state officials have authority . significantly , it is those same national borders that demarcate the extent of @entity15 's leaders ability -- or even desire , perhaps -- to use their capacity for state - sanctioned violence . other countries -- including @entity0 -- have no such inhibitions and regularly kill perfectly innocent civilians in the course of one conflict or another . this propensity for the application of state - sanctioned violence seems especially germane when we consider another president about whom great things were expected , but who has inevitably disappointed . after the unilateralism of @entity110 , @entity108 was widely predicted to be a very different sort of president and one who would not make the sort of catastrophic strategic miscalculations of his predecessor . paradoxically enough , though , while @entity108 has been widely criticized for a lack of decisiveness and unwillingness to commit more @entity124 forces to the @entity125 , this has done nothing to curb the use of state - sanctioned violence . on the contrary , the use of drone strikes has become a key part of @entity124 's continuing war on terror . it is unsurprising , perhaps , that a cerebral and reflective leader as @entity108 is should be attracted to drones as a weapon of choice . unlike @entity56 , @entity108 does n't have to confront the personal narratives of the people who die at his command . or he does n't unless they 're @entity124 citizens , at least . the recent death of an @entity124 hostage during a recent drone strike highlights the potential for " collateral damage " . are these cases comparable ?

@entity0 ( @entity1 ) many australians are understandably appalled by the brutal and pointless executions of @entity4 and @entity5*****0
the death penalty looks anachronistic and ineffective at the best of times , but to kill two people who had clearly made the most of their long periods of incarceration to transform themselves and make amends for their actions looks gratuitous and cruel*****0
consequently , @entity15 's actions raise more general questions about the powers we give to states -- or , more accurately , to those who control the coercive apparatus of the state at any particular moment*****1
as @entity28 sociologist @entity27 pointed out , one of the key features of an effective state is that it has a monopoly over the legitimate use of violence*****0
state officials can order people to be killed because -- especially in democracies -- we authorize them to do so*****1
we can give no more significant power to another human being than to decide who lives or who dies*****0
and yet even where that authority is deemed legitimate -- as is clearly the case in @entity15 -- its significance is only seriously considered at moments like this , when the very personal circumstances of some of its victims become the stuff of popular commentary and media interest*****0
less prominent victims of state - sanctioned violence often go entirely unremarked*****0
however disappointed we may be in the actions of @entity15 president @entity56 -- in whom so many inside and outside @entity15 have invested such hopes as a progressive force -- he can make a couple of claims in his defense*****0
first , @entity62 -- popularly known as @entity56 -- is @entity15 's elected leader and is fulfilling his promise to crack down on what he and many other @entity15 see as a problem*****1
@entity15 's domestic political context and the need to be seen as not giving favorable treatment to foreigners left him very little room to maneuver*****1
this is not a justification for his actions , but it helps to explain why he was so impervious to pleas for mercy*****1
whatever we may think about the underlying principles and administration of justice in @entity15 , at least @entity56 can claim that it is essentially a domestic issue*****0
we may not like @entity15 's laws , but they are being applied even - handedly within national borders where state officials have authority*****1
significantly , it is those same national borders that demarcate the extent of @entity15 's leaders ability -- or even desire , perhaps -- to use their capacity for state - sanctioned violence*****1
other countries -- including @entity0 -- have no such inhibitions and regularly kill perfectly innocent civilians in the course of one conflict or another*****1
this propensity for the application of state - sanctioned violence seems especially germane when we consider another president about whom great things were expected , but who has inevitably disappointed*****0
after the unilateralism of @entity110 , @entity108 was widely predicted to be a very different sort of president and one who would not make the sort of catastrophic strategic miscalculations of his predecessor*****0
paradoxically enough , though , while @entity108 has been widely criticized for a lack of decisiveness and unwillingness to commit more @entity124 forces to the @entity125 , this has done nothing to curb the use of state - sanctioned violence*****0
on the contrary , the use of drone strikes has become a key part of @entity124 's continuing war on terror*****0
it is unsurprising , perhaps , that a cerebral and reflective leader as @entity108 is should be attracted to drones as a weapon of choice*****0
unlike @entity56 , @entity108 does n't have to confront the personal narratives of the people who die at his command*****0
or he does n't unless they 're @entity124 citizens , at least*****0
the recent death of an @entity124 hostage during a recent drone strike highlights the potential for " collateral damage "*****0
are these cases comparable ? yes and no. @entity56 's executions were cold - blooded , unnecessary and highly political*****0
@entity108 clearly was not intending to kill @entity124 , and this has only become an issue because one of the hostages actually was*****0
however , dozens of entirely innocent women and children from other countries are routinely killed in such strikes with little comment*****1
the key point is that we are collectively responsible for such deaths at some level or another , especially if our leaders and state officials carry them out*****0

would we encourage the state to kill a thousand innocents if it meant eliminating @entity173 ? almost certainly*****0
would we authorize a drone strike to kill @entity177 leader @entity175 if we thought a couple of passers - by might die , too ? perhaps*****0

but before we congratulate ourselves on how civilized and humane we 've become , perhaps we should pause to consider the violence that is still being inflicted on perfectly innocent people around the world in our collective name*****1
