( @entity1 ) as we approach april 27 when @entity2 marks the anniversary of the first post-apartheid elections held that day in 1994 , we are faced with yet another wave of deadly attacks against @entity8 migrants*****1
outrage triggered by this violence is being heard loudly throughout social media with " @entity12 " showcasing the need for a common front against this affront*****0
these recurring attacks against migrants and their property might be read as one more indication of how the rainbow nation 's dream has faltered*****0
that vision not only symbolized a multi-ethnic @entity2 , but one where living in dignity is shared across racial and class lines*****0
attacks against newcomers in @entity2 are often reduced to attitudes of hate and resentment towards other black @entity8*****1
the national and international headlines use " xenophobia " as if any one word can convey the multifaceted crisis within which this phenomenon occurs*****0
labeling this turmoil as xenophobic fails to convey the conditions in which @entity8 migrants are scapegoated for the persistent legacy of apartheid in the post-liberation era*****0
this word also does not tell us that extreme poverty now exceeds that experienced under apartheid*****0
and it certainly does not account for how extreme inequality is now fully embraced and normalized by a new black elite joining the " white - haves " of yesteryear*****0
the question of why foreign blacks are targeted and not foreign whites is also repeated ad nauseam , as if the majority of black citizens and @entity8 migrants share any common spaces and experiences with white @entity2 or white foreigners*****1
contact between the majority of african migrant groups and native black @entity2 mostly occurs in under - developed informal settlements and townships*****1
in the interaction and competition between these groups in these spaces , we need to be wary of the simplistic treatment of @entity2 's ailment as xenophobia*****0
such labeling does not and can not explain the totality of the contact , competition and conflict between native poor black @entity2 and foreign @entity8 entrepreneurs*****1
attention as to how such interactions occur in an environment where a vast portion of @entity2 's black majority experiences segregation , persistent and relative poverty , and high crime rates in post-apartheid @entity2 is paramount*****1
neglecting access to social rights , such as water , electricity , education and other services , is tantamount to violence by political leaders against the poor*****1
condemning and prosecuting those who incite violence is essential to maintaining law and order and protecting those vulnerable because of their nationality*****0
but the evictions , harassment and ultimately brutal killings of foreigners can not and should not be separated from the daily brutal violence poor @entity2 in informal settlements and many townships experience*****1
it can not and should not be separated from @entity2 's status as one of the most unequal societies in the world ; it can not and should not be separated from the fact that @entity2 has one of the highest homicide levels in the world*****1
a mantra of xenophobia wishes away the fact that the everyday lives of those in vulnerable positions in this society ( the poor , the disabled , women , children , the elderly ) are filled with violence similar -- if not worse -- than that facing @entity8 foreigners eking out a living in the midst of abject poverty*****1
labeling @entity2 's poor blacks as ungrateful and amnesiac to the history of hospitality other @entity8 bestowed on their exiles under apartheid does a disservice to both the local poor whose citizenship rights are marginal at best and the resilient migrants in search of asylum and dignity*****1
such labeling only serves politicians and the elites who are sealed off by barbed wire surrounded by a security industry that outspends and outnumbers @entity2 's police force*****0
it allows corruption to persist while the political leaders who are implicated in this violence scapegoat " criminal youth " to further fill an overflowing prison industry*****0
religious and civil society leaders ' recent mobilization saying " not in our name " in reaction to violence against migrants should be applauded*****0
but religious , civil society and student groups also have an obligation to organize and denounce the inequality and the violence that is the everyday lot of the extremely poor in @entity2*****1
@entity171 misery and corruption in the midst of a nation with so much potential should not be tolerated*****0
neither a hashtag of outrage @entity12 nor the expedience of the label " xenophobia " can wish away the angst , violence and the impending crisis in @entity2*****1
migrants ' security and dignity is part and parcel of a greater security and dignity for all @entity2 , which seem deferred for now .*****0
