( @entity4 ) monday night , as unrest raged across @entity3 's streets , @entity0 lay awake in her @entity6 home , a neighborhood in the northern part of the city , thinking about what the next day would be like . as a co-owner of @entity13 's , a cafe in the intersection of three major @entity3 neighborhoods , @entity11 knew that the cafe and its workers needed to support the city after all the unrest . " there was some fear , but it was really mixed in with an overwhelming sense that everyone here needs help , " she said . as protests erupt nationwide after the death of @entity30 , a black man who suffered a severe spinal cord injury while in police custody , some local businesses in @entity3 are banding together to show their support for the city , while others are left to rebuild or repair after monday 's riot . late monday evening over email , @entity11 and other workers from @entity39 's decided that the cafe would remain closed on tuesday so that staff members could spend the day in the community to help clean up or peacefully protest . 45 @entity45 workers still getting paid after riots shut down stores the following morning , they posted a sign on the door telling patrons they were closed to partake in community action ( the cafe was not in monday 's protest zone ) . " we shut down not out of fear , but for solidarity , " @entity11 said . it was solidarity for @entity3 , for the " @entity61 " movement and for the local businesses that were destroyed during the rioting , the five - year @entity3 resident explained . with a warm , steaming crock pot of chicken and a cooler of ice water , @entity13 's staff member @entity66 made his way down to the center of the rallying tuesday and set up a stand . it was one of a handful of businesses passing out free food and water to protesters . the movement in @entity3 is personal for @entity66 . the 23 - year - old has been out on the streets peacefully demonstrating and offering free food every day since protests first started . " i have witnessed police brutality . i was roughed up by police before . it is something you do n't have to look very far to witness in @entity3 , " he said . the decision for @entity39 's to close temporarily -- it has since reopened -- was meaningful , @entity66 said . " our shop has been a part of the community since it opened , and we thought it was important to be a part of the community especially now . " the feeling on @entity3 's streets has changed dramatically over the past few days . it 's now peaceful and somewhat celebratory , @entity66 said . " there have been protests , but there have also been celebrations of all us together , and you ca n't have a celebration without food , " he said . not all businesses fared well . some suffered major losses . @entity111 's store @entity110 on @entity112 was ransacked monday . her windows were smashed and her merchandised looted . " they wiped me out , " the 36 - year - old said . she understands the frustration and can see why some local businesses are joining the movement to stand with their city , but she 's also depressed that her business , one that she opened only four months ago , was destroyed in the wake of the unrest . and there are reports that the weeklong curfew is affecting smaller businesses . " this is not a black or white issue . this has been going on decades . but there are ways to protest without hurting people , destroying buildings and looting , " @entity131 said . in the meantime , she is thinking about boarding up her storefront just to be safe . other businesses outside the major protest zones stayed open to be a resource for the community this past week . @entity144 , an owner and worker at the cooperative restaurant and bookstore @entity148 's , decided to stay open after the upheaval on monday . when workers heard that schools were going to be closed tuesday , they felt the need to keep their door opens in order to provide free meals to students and those who are the most vulnerable in the city . " we saw it on social media that people were trying to figure out how to feed school children who depend on school lunches and we thought we could stand in solidarity with folks , " the 37 - year - old said . the response was incredible , he said . not only were students coming in for free lunches , but @entity3 residents were coming by to see whether they could volunteer and offer their support . " i was initially a little concerned that the reaction and the unrest on monday would take away from important issues facing the city , " @entity144 said . but he has seen residents of the city step up to show their support for not only @entity30 , but the need to address social and economic disparities in the city . it has inspired the 12 - year @entity3 resident and business owner to start peacefully protesting as well . on wednesday , with the sun setting in the background , @entity144 marched with a group down the streets of @entity3 . the scene was beautiful , @entity144 said . @entity148 's is normally closed during the 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew , with the exception of having to close an hour early this friday and saturday . @entity13 's is not normally open during the curfew hours . @entity144 said many of the people marching were n't just marching for @entity30 ; they were also marching for better education and work opportunities . @entity144 said these people have been voicing their frustrations for years , but it seems like now they are finally being heard . " it took the city to almost tear itself apart for it to start coming together . "
