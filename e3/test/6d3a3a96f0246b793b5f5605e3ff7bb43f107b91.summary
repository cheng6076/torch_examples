@entity13 went out in 32 and briefly raised the crowd 's hopes that he had a sniff of completing an improbable @entity17 on sunday night*****0
but he dropped two shots late on in the round to finish six under par. woods comeback ? a rejuvenated @entity22 showed touches of his old class mixed with the ragged unpredictability that has marked his new game to finish six under too*****0
a huge improvement , but still a long way from him wearing the green jacket again*****0

" @entity33 powered around the course , threatening to challenge too , finishing on eleven under*****0
as did a late @entity36 surge , where he fired four birdies in a row to finish twelve under and in second place*****0
in the end , there was lots of moving , but no one could move quick enough or far enough to trouble @entity44*****0
@entity46 the 21 year old has been nothing short of a sensation at @entity50*****1
his infallible first two rounds gave the 21 year old from @entity52 , @entity53 a five shot lead going in to the third round*****1
that has happened only three times at @entity50 before , and on all three occasions the leader has gone on to win*****0
@entity44 's 15 birdies are just 10 away from @entity33 's masters mark set in 2001*****0
he could also break @entity22 270 set in 1997*****0
as it happened , @entity44 played a steady , almost conservative round*****0
when he made the occasional mistake , like the bogey at 15 , he hit back straight away with a birdie next hole*****0
as his third round came to a close the birdies flowed , his putting impeccable*****0
the only nerves on show came during the last two holes with a double bogey at the 17*****0
echos of 1996 ? when reminded of some of the great @entity50 comebacks , including @entity79 's 11 shot swing in 1996 , @entity22 still believes anything is possible*****0

yet , for all the movement of @entity33 , @entity22 , @entity101 and @entity13 , they made just a one shot dent into @entity44 's second round lead*****1
he will begin sunday four shots ahead .*****0
