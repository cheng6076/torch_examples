@entity3 stands accused of scrubbing part of a segment in his @entity7 documentary series " finding your roots " because the actor @entity10 put pressure on him*****1
@entity10 's concern was that the segment would have aired his family 's dirty laundry , which includes a slaveholding ancestor , @entity16*****1
@entity10 said , in a statement posted on @entity18 , that he " did n't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves*****1
i was embarrassed*****0
" and @entity3 later explained that he subbed that part of the segment for another that made for more " compelling television*****1
" but providing a window into the importance of slavery 's past to @entity33 's present should never just be about what makes for good television*****0
@entity3 missed an opportunity*****1
and @entity10 's initial reluctance to acknowledge his truth ( an impulse , he said on @entity18 , he regrets ) is surprising*****1
last month , @entity10 lent his star power to support continued foreign assistance for the @entity42 by testifying before @entity43*****0
he is n't shy about aligning himself with causes and issues*****0
what more could he do if his instinct is also to tackle issues closer to home : the legacy of slavery in his own family tree and how it is possible -- necessary -- to reject the racism passed through generations even today*****0
he should have shown the courage to stay in an uncomfortable place*****0
what a teachable moment for the country*****0
in any case , why did he agree to do a television show if he was concerned about what might be discovered ? he could have paid a genealogist to uncover his ancestry , if privacy was what he wanted*****0
the irony here is that none of this would have ever been found out if @entity72 's emails had not been hacked and if @entity3 had n't written to @entity73 , ceo of @entity72 , for advice*****1
in the leaked exchange , @entity73 advised : " i would take it out if no one knows , but if it gets out that you are editing the material based on this kind of sensitivity then it gets tricky*****0

if @entity3 thought there was no need for the slavery segment because it did n't make for good television , there would have been no need to consult with @entity73 ; @entity90 could have given @entity10 what he wanted because he made the assessment of how strong @entity10 's story was*****1
the original script , reprinted on @entity112 and elsewhere , makes it clear , however , that the slave - owner angle makes for better television*****1
here are some excerpts : @entity3 sets up the segment describing @entity16 as living in @entity118 , @entity119*****1

this is the kind of enlightened approach @entity3 and @entity7 should have been interested in facilitating*****0
@entity175 ' lack of comfort in talking about slavery , race and the places in our society where racism continues to fester is at the heart of why even with a black president , we are still , as a country , far from post-racial*****1
@entity10 's segment had the potential to continue an important dialogue -- but the brand management part of @entity10 won , and the rest is history*****1
the fallout continues*****0
@entity3 has to deal with @entity7 and @entity195 's internal review*****1
he should not walk away without consequences*****0
if you 're going to run with the megastars , you need to have mega-ethics .*****0
