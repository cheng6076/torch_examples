( @entity0 ) there are two paths to practicing medicine in @entity4*****0
there 's the traditional , time - tested way , where new doctors graduate from medical school and then pass a series of national exams while training for years as resident physicians*****1
then there 's the approach being forged in @entity14 and @entity15 : getting elected to a state legislature*****1
lawmakers in those states are too often donning the white coats to orchestrate medical practice*****1
in 2011 , @entity14 enacted the @entity21 , which threatens prosecution and loss of licensure for any physicians who dare ask their patients about gun ownership and gun safety*****1
guns are a scientifically uncontested health risk*****0
asking about them is standard practice in pediatrics and psychiatry*****0
i treat brain injuries , and it 's part of my job to talk with patients about things that might be unsafe for them , like driving*****0
and handling weapons*****0
some of those i treat suffered their injuries by bullets , typically fired by family members or themselves*****0
does anyone really believe i should n't talk about gun safety in these cases ? it 's a good thing i do n't practice in @entity14*****1
@entity14 's gun censorship law was dragged into court soon after the governor signed it , and while a three - judge appeals panel upheld the law last summer , doctors can still ask about guns while the full 11th @entity64 decides whether it will take up the case , a decision that could come down any day , the president of the @entity14 chapter of the @entity55 , dr. @entity56 , told me*****1
he is a plaintiff in the case*****0
in @entity15 , another assault on physician free speech is scheduled to go into effect this summer*****0
@entity71 goes a step beyond silencing doctors*****0
it requires them to lie*****0
the bill was originally a hum - drum attempt to block health plans from covering abortion services , a common state and federal strategy*****0
but legislators slid in a last - minute provision mandating that physicians who prescribe the abortion pill @entity86 tell patients the pill is reversible*****1
that 's the opinion of a particular @entity91 doctor who says this can be done through risky , large doses of progesterone*****0
but the doctor has n't proven his case , and his regimen is not recommended by the @entity97 or the @entity98*****0
any doctor is certainly within his or her rights to review the limited information available about the @entity91 regimen and decide whether to discuss it with patients , but actually requiring physicians to make claims most believe to be untrue and unsafe means the legislators are overstepping their bounds and interfering with the patient - doctor relationship*****1
i can not imagine anyone attempting to put words into the mouth of a lawyer privately consulting with a client*****0
why are physicians putting up with a professional assault the @entity119 would never permit ? dr. @entity120 , chairwoman of the @entity15 chapter of the @entity97 , told me the amendment was added shortly before she was scheduled to testify about the bill before the @entity124*****0
while @entity126 and the @entity127 joined her organization in criticizing the provision , the bill passed both chambers and was recently signed by the governor*****0
there 's a common relationship shared by these laws , beyond turning doctors into government spokespeople*****0
these laws capitalize on controversial issues to divide and conquer*****0
physicians do n't all share the same opinions on abortion and guns any more than they all vote @entity144 or @entity145*****0
this is part of the reason the key state physicians ' associations are n't taking the lead in battling these laws*****0
the battle is left to the specialties most affected*****0
in @entity14 , that 's the state 's chapter of the @entity55 , since pediatricians are most likely to ask about guns in the home*****0
in @entity15 , it 's the state chapter of the @entity97 carrying the torch for physician free speech*****0
the @entity162 did n't provide me with details about whether it has a lobbying effort against the gun law , and the @entity168 told me in a statement that " @entity171 's policy is to take no position on abortion*****1
" representing physicians as a whole , the state medical associations have the most political clout in statehouses*****0
the @entity179 ( @entity180 ) tried to utilize that power recently when it decided to dedicate " @entity186 " to the issue of physician free speech , highlighting the threat posed by @entity14 's gun law in particular*****1
members are concerned about the precedent being set*****0
@entity189 enacted a law similar to @entity15 just days later*****1
the @entity191 can do more*****0
it did file a friend - of - the - court brief as part of the @entity14 legal challenge , but at this writing has n't weighed in on @entity15*****1
the @entity171 did n't sign on to a statement released last week by the @entity198 to protect the patient - provider relationship that hits hard on the new abortion laws as an affront to good medical care*****1
its huge lobbying operations are tied up in @entity204 , while states are the main battleground over the integrity of medical practice*****0
now that the @entity171 has won the age - old " doc fix " battle , ending automatic @entity214 payment cuts to doctors , perhaps it will consider assigning some of its $ 18 million lobbying team to stand in for lackluster state affiliates who 've abdicated their responsibility to vigorously defend the medical profession*****1
we have a surgeon general now , @entity224 , and he is on a national listening tour while he prepares to announce his areas of policy focus on april 22 , @entity228 , a @entity230 spokesman told me*****0
i hope @entity224 will see beyond the bluster of abortion and gun politics and zero in on a key issue affecting public health -- free and unfettered communication between patients and doctors .*****1
