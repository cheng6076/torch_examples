( @entity1 ) by now , you probably have a position regarding the controversy over @entity5 's religious freedom law . you applaud the growing chorus of companies blasting the law as an invitation for businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians , using religion as a cover . or , like @entity5 gov. @entity15 , you are surprised at the backlash and maintain that it is basically a copy of a law that is already in the books at the federal level and 19 other states . the issue drives a wedge because , well , the debate over religious freedom and gay rights is always heated , but also because the interpretations and motives behind the law can be questioned . whichever side you 're on , here are five things you might not have considered when thinking about this controversy . these points might not change your mind , but offer context to better understand the uproar . as the author of the 1993 federal @entity41 ( @entity41 ) , sen. @entity39 is one who can offer clarity over the controversy surrounding @entity5 's version of the law . @entity39 mocks @entity5 's contention that the state law is simply a mirror of the 22 - year - old federal law . " that may be true only if you 're using a funhouse mirror , " @entity39 wrote on his @entity50 page . the federal law was intended to protect individual 's religious freedom from government intervention , he said . the @entity5 law justifies discrimination in the name of religious freedom , he contends . also , the law was envisioned to protect the religious freedoms of individuals , while the @entity5 law also protects private companies , @entity39 said . so , how can the law 's supporters claim it is basically a copy of the federal law ? if you look at the purpose of the law , the language in the federal and @entity5 religious freedom laws are indeed nearly indistinguishable . in short -- the government can not interfere with a person 's religious practices unless there is a compelling government interest to do so . the uproar is over that fact that the @entity5 law expands the reach of the religious protections to include private companies and cases where the government is not involved . other states previously passed their own version of the religious freedom law -- @entity5 became the 20th . but other state laws mirror the federal law much more closely than the @entity5 law does . the key difference in the @entity5 law is that it expands the instances where someone can use religious freedom as a defense . this is how it could make a difference : in 2006 , @entity100 contacted a photographer about shooting her commitment ceremony with her partner . this was in @entity105 , a state with a religious freedom law at the time of the dispute . the company , @entity109 , refused the job because of the co-owner 's religious beliefs . @entity100 sued @entity109 for discrimination , and the company defended itself by citing the law . the photography studio lost the case because the court ruled that it could not use the religious freedom law because the dispute was between two private parties and not a government entity . what would happen if that case happened today in @entity5 , with the new , expanded religious freedom law ? for sure , the case would have proceeded to trial , said @entity127 , a law professor at @entity128 . the photography studio would have had the chance to make its argument in court that it denied the service because of religious reasons . would the outcome have been the same ? would an @entity5 jury side with the company that refused service to a couple because of their sexual orientation ? in a letter expressing concern about the @entity5 law , a group of 30 legal scholars argued that what @entity5 has done is expanded the scope of the law to the point that religious considerations might trump discrimination concerns . " in our expert opinion , the clear evidence ... unmistakably demonstrates that the broad language of the proposed state @entity41 will more likely create confusion , conflict , and a wave of litigation that will threaten the clarity of religious liberty rights in @entity5 while undermining the state 's ability to enforce other compelling interests , " the letter , whose signatories included many @entity5 law professors , stated . these concerns are based on speculation of what might happen , said @entity174 , a constitutional law professor at @entity175 . yes , the @entity5 law makes it clear that individuals and private companies can use the religious freedom law as a defense , he said . " but , just because you raise the defense does not mean it will be successful . " those who try to defend their discriminatory actions in court tend to lose , @entity174 said . in his opinion , if @entity109 had been able to use the law as a defense in @entity105 , it still likely would have lost the case . what 's clear is that @entity5 's law increases the potential pool of people who can defend themselves claiming religious freedom . the success of such arguments is to be seen . in the meantime , some are already hatching plans on how to test the law , including @entity202 , founder of @entity203 , who argued on @entity1 that the law should protect his right to smoke pot. much is being made of the fact that the first religious freedom law was signed by president @entity209 more than 20 years ago . there was bipartisan support in 1993 , so why the commotion over a similar law in 2015 , some ask ? context , timing and intent have changed the way these laws are viewed . the federal law was written by two democrats , @entity39 and the late sen. @entity222 . today , it is being championed by @entity224 . the law came into being after two @entity226 in @entity227 were fired from their jobs at a rehab clinic because they had consumed peyote , the hallucinogenic cactus . they were denied unemployment benefits , and they sued the state , claiming that the peyote was part of their religious customs . they lost the case . there was outrage over the decision , and the law was created as a remedy . as envisioned by its authors , it would protect the freedoms of religious minorities . over the years , the law helped a number of people -- a @entity256 prisoner won the right to grow a short beard , a @entity251 priest was allowed to sacrifice a goat on special religious occasions , and a native american boy received an exception to his school 's policy banning long hair on boys . the law was on the books for years , with little attention paid to it . but @entity127 says it is no coincidence that the religious freedom laws became popular at the state level just as the gay rights and marriage equality movement made historic steps . many states are using the laws to carve out exceptions to allow @entity280 to deny services to same - sex couples . @entity127 said . " the timing is beyond a coincidence , " he said . " we are having an interest in @entity41 at the time same - sex marriage is coming forward . " though not enshrined in the law , critics accuse the states pursuing the laws of using them to justify discrimination by the majority religion . @entity174 said the history of the state religious freedom laws shows that they have not turned into conduits for discrimination . the expanded laws might mean more people will defend themselves using it , but most will likely lose , he said . " the moral outrage over this reflects how uninformed people are on the history of the @entity41 , " he said . so we 've established that the biggest difference between the federal law and the @entity5 law is the scope : in @entity5 , the law can be raised as a defense in private disputes , while the federal law applies only to government matters . not so fast . according to @entity174 , the interpretations of the federal religious freedom law are not uniform . four @entity320 circuit courts of appeals have ruled that the federal law can be used as a defense in cases involving private parties . two other appeals courts have ruled that this is not allowed . and then , there is the @entity330 case . @entity330 , citing the federal religious freedom law , argued that it should not have to provide contraception coverage through insurance to its employees via @entity335 because it was against the owners ' beliefs . and , @entity330 won the case before the @entity339 . the ruling , in effect , expanded the reach of the federal law to include a business . the @entity330 decision , plus the appeals courts rulings , may have opened the door for states like @entity5 to be explicit about its expansion of the law . one way to look at it , @entity174 said , is that @entity5 simply clarified and codified something that is hazy in the federal courts . the outrage over the @entity5 law is that it can be used to deny services to the @entity358 on the ground of religious beliefs . some may rightfully ask , " where was the outrage before the religious freedom law ? " @entity5 does not have an nondiscrimination law that protects people based on sexual orientation or gender identity . in that sense , the religious freedom law is not necessary for those who want to discriminate against gays and lesbians . even before the controversial @entity5 law was passed , if a restaurant denied service to a gay couple , the couple might be able to sue , but not for discrimination . for that matter , there is also no federal law that protects the @entity383 community . according to the @entity387 , lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people are sometimes fired , denied a promotion or harassed in the workplace . and their recourse is limited . with the proliferation of religious freedom state laws , nondiscrimination laws become even more important . another hypothetical outcome of the @entity105 case involving the lesbian couple and the photography studio . if @entity105 had the same religious freedom law as @entity5 , the case would have gone to trial . but @entity105 has a nondiscrimination law that protects the @entity383 community , it and it would have provided a strong counter-argument to the religious freedom claim . in @entity5 , that protection would be lacking . ( it gets more complicated when some local governments , like the city of @entity407 , do have nondiscrimination ordinances ) . for this reason , @entity127 suggests that a " fix " for the @entity5 law would be the passage of a nondiscrimination law . or , at the very least , an exception written into the religious freedom bill that protects from such discrimination .

( @entity1 ) by now , you probably have a position regarding the controversy over @entity5 's religious freedom law*****1
you applaud the growing chorus of companies blasting the law as an invitation for businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians , using religion as a cover*****0
or , like @entity5 gov. @entity15 , you are surprised at the backlash and maintain that it is basically a copy of a law that is already in the books at the federal level and 19 other states*****1
the issue drives a wedge because , well , the debate over religious freedom and gay rights is always heated , but also because the interpretations and motives behind the law can be questioned*****1
whichever side you 're on , here are five things you might not have considered when thinking about this controversy*****1
these points might not change your mind , but offer context to better understand the uproar*****0
as the author of the 1993 federal @entity41 ( @entity41 ) , sen. @entity39 is one who can offer clarity over the controversy surrounding @entity5 's version of the law*****1
@entity39 mocks @entity5 's contention that the state law is simply a mirror of the 22 - year - old federal law*****1
" that may be true only if you 're using a funhouse mirror , " @entity39 wrote on his @entity50 page*****0
the federal law was intended to protect individual 's religious freedom from government intervention , he said*****1
the @entity5 law justifies discrimination in the name of religious freedom , he contends*****1
also , the law was envisioned to protect the religious freedoms of individuals , while the @entity5 law also protects private companies , @entity39 said*****1
so , how can the law 's supporters claim it is basically a copy of the federal law ? if you look at the purpose of the law , the language in the federal and @entity5 religious freedom laws are indeed nearly indistinguishable*****1
in short -- the government can not interfere with a person 's religious practices unless there is a compelling government interest to do so*****1
the uproar is over that fact that the @entity5 law expands the reach of the religious protections to include private companies and cases where the government is not involved*****1
other states previously passed their own version of the religious freedom law -- @entity5 became the 20th*****1
but other state laws mirror the federal law much more closely than the @entity5 law does*****1
the key difference in the @entity5 law is that it expands the instances where someone can use religious freedom as a defense*****1
this is how it could make a difference : in 2006 , @entity100 contacted a photographer about shooting her commitment ceremony with her partner*****0
this was in @entity105 , a state with a religious freedom law at the time of the dispute*****1
the company , @entity109 , refused the job because of the co-owner 's religious beliefs*****1
@entity100 sued @entity109 for discrimination , and the company defended itself by citing the law*****0
the photography studio lost the case because the court ruled that it could not use the religious freedom law because the dispute was between two private parties and not a government entity*****1
what would happen if that case happened today in @entity5 , with the new , expanded religious freedom law ? for sure , the case would have proceeded to trial , said @entity127 , a law professor at @entity128*****1
the photography studio would have had the chance to make its argument in court that it denied the service because of religious reasons*****0
would the outcome have been the same ? would an @entity5 jury side with the company that refused service to a couple because of their sexual orientation ? in a letter expressing concern about the @entity5 law , a group of 30 legal scholars argued that what @entity5 has done is expanded the scope of the law to the point that religious considerations might trump discrimination concerns*****1
" in our expert opinion , the clear evidence ... unmistakably demonstrates that the broad language of the proposed state @entity41 will more likely create confusion , conflict , and a wave of litigation that will threaten the clarity of religious liberty rights in @entity5 while undermining the state 's ability to enforce other compelling interests , " the letter , whose signatories included many @entity5 law professors , stated*****1
these concerns are based on speculation of what might happen , said @entity174 , a constitutional law professor at @entity175*****0
yes , the @entity5 law makes it clear that individuals and private companies can use the religious freedom law as a defense , he said*****1
" but , just because you raise the defense does not mean it will be successful*****0
" those who try to defend their discriminatory actions in court tend to lose , @entity174 said*****0
in his opinion , if @entity109 had been able to use the law as a defense in @entity105 , it still likely would have lost the case*****0
what 's clear is that @entity5 's law increases the potential pool of people who can defend themselves claiming religious freedom*****1
the success of such arguments is to be seen*****0
in the meantime , some are already hatching plans on how to test the law , including @entity202 , founder of @entity203 , who argued on @entity1 that the law should protect his right to smoke pot. much is being made of the fact that the first religious freedom law was signed by president @entity209 more than 20 years ago*****1
there was bipartisan support in 1993 , so why the commotion over a similar law in 2015 , some ask ? context , timing and intent have changed the way these laws are viewed*****0
the federal law was written by two democrats , @entity39 and the late sen. @entity222*****0
today , it is being championed by @entity224*****0
the law came into being after two @entity226 in @entity227 were fired from their jobs at a rehab clinic because they had consumed peyote , the hallucinogenic cactus*****0
they were denied unemployment benefits , and they sued the state , claiming that the peyote was part of their religious customs*****0
they lost the case*****0
there was outrage over the decision , and the law was created as a remedy*****0
as envisioned by its authors , it would protect the freedoms of religious minorities*****0
over the years , the law helped a number of people -- a @entity256 prisoner won the right to grow a short beard , a @entity251 priest was allowed to sacrifice a goat on special religious occasions , and a native american boy received an exception to his school 's policy banning long hair on boys*****1
the law was on the books for years , with little attention paid to it*****0
but @entity127 says it is no coincidence that the religious freedom laws became popular at the state level just as the gay rights and marriage equality movement made historic steps*****1
many states are using the laws to carve out exceptions to allow @entity280 to deny services to same - sex couples*****0
@entity127 said*****0
" the timing is beyond a coincidence , " he said*****0
" we are having an interest in @entity41 at the time same - sex marriage is coming forward*****0
" though not enshrined in the law , critics accuse the states pursuing the laws of using them to justify discrimination by the majority religion*****0
@entity174 said the history of the state religious freedom laws shows that they have not turned into conduits for discrimination*****1
the expanded laws might mean more people will defend themselves using it , but most will likely lose , he said*****0
" the moral outrage over this reflects how uninformed people are on the history of the @entity41 , " he said*****0
so we 've established that the biggest difference between the federal law and the @entity5 law is the scope : in @entity5 , the law can be raised as a defense in private disputes , while the federal law applies only to government matters*****1
not so fast*****0
according to @entity174 , the interpretations of the federal religious freedom law are not uniform*****1
four @entity320 circuit courts of appeals have ruled that the federal law can be used as a defense in cases involving private parties*****0
two other appeals courts have ruled that this is not allowed*****0
and then , there is the @entity330 case*****0
@entity330 , citing the federal religious freedom law , argued that it should not have to provide contraception coverage through insurance to its employees via @entity335 because it was against the owners ' beliefs*****1
and , @entity330 won the case before the @entity339*****0
the ruling , in effect , expanded the reach of the federal law to include a business*****0
the @entity330 decision , plus the appeals courts rulings , may have opened the door for states like @entity5 to be explicit about its expansion of the law*****1
one way to look at it , @entity174 said , is that @entity5 simply clarified and codified something that is hazy in the federal courts*****0
the outrage over the @entity5 law is that it can be used to deny services to the @entity358 on the ground of religious beliefs*****1
some may rightfully ask , " where was the outrage before the religious freedom law ? " @entity5 does not have an nondiscrimination law that protects people based on sexual orientation or gender identity*****1
in that sense , the religious freedom law is not necessary for those who want to discriminate against gays and lesbians*****1
even before the controversial @entity5 law was passed , if a restaurant denied service to a gay couple , the couple might be able to sue , but not for discrimination*****1
for that matter , there is also no federal law that protects the @entity383 community*****0
according to the @entity387 , lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people are sometimes fired , denied a promotion or harassed in the workplace*****0
and their recourse is limited*****0
with the proliferation of religious freedom state laws , nondiscrimination laws become even more important*****1
another hypothetical outcome of the @entity105 case involving the lesbian couple and the photography studio*****0
if @entity105 had the same religious freedom law as @entity5 , the case would have gone to trial*****1
but @entity105 has a nondiscrimination law that protects the @entity383 community , it and it would have provided a strong counter-argument to the religious freedom claim*****1
in @entity5 , that protection would be lacking*****0
( it gets more complicated when some local governments , like the city of @entity407 , do have nondiscrimination ordinances )*****0
for this reason , @entity127 suggests that a " fix " for the @entity5 law would be the passage of a nondiscrimination law*****1
or , at the very least , an exception written into the religious freedom bill that protects from such discrimination .*****1
