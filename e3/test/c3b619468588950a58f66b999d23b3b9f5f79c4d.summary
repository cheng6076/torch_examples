( @entity1 ) @entity0 , my @entity3 senator and , indeed , a friend of many years , is now running for president . he noted at his announcement ( with a familiar note of wise irony ) : " people should not underestimate me . " to most @entity12 , of course , sen. @entity0 is only a name , if that . he is barely known to the general public , which makes him a very long shot indeed to win election to the highest office in the nation . those who follow politics a little more closely will possibly think of him as some left - wing kook that only the most liberal state in the union would ever dream of electing to the @entity26 , as we did in 2006 . let me add this , as someone who has followed him closely ( and with admiration ) for a long time : when people stop to listen to @entity0 , they realize that -- whether or not they agree with his ideas -- he is , without a question , an authentic voice who speaks without fear . and nobody should underestimate him . i remember when @entity0 was mayor of @entity41 ; it is the largest city in @entity3 ( which is n't saying much ) . i met him then , and his voice struck me as something not quite heard before . he spoke with a throaty @entity47 accent , and he was @entity48 -- not your typical @entity49 . he served as mayor of this progressive town on the shores of @entity54 with remarkable energy for many years , listening closely to what people had to say , learning about politics at the local level , making a real difference in the daily lives of hard - working people . he was never a @entity63 -- and is n't yet . he 's a progressive , holding his seat in the @entity26 as an independent , although he votes with the @entity65 on major issues . when @entity0 decided to run for @entity69 ' seat in the @entity70 in 1988 , many considered him a long shot . i remember hosting a fundraising event at my farmhouse , where @entity0 held the floor for almost two hours , answering questions with a forthrightness that stunned those who had never encountered in person his fierce , funny , entertaining , passionate voice . @entity0 won that seat , again and again . make no mistake about this : @entity3 is n't just a rainbow - colored state full of ex-hippies and leftists in berets . it 's an agricultural economy , and @entity0 has understood this well . he has thoughtfully supported @entity3 's dairy - farming community over many years . he has also been a strong supporter of @entity3 's hunting culture -- much to the annoyance of many on the left , who wonder why the @entity94 does n't attack him . i was never prouder of @entity0 than during the run - up to the invasion of @entity98 . he was a singular and somewhat lonely voice in the @entity70 , strongly opposing the 2003 invasion . he saw vividly that this was the worst foreign policy move in @entity12 history , one with endless repercussions . he was especially outraged by the outing of former @entity106 spy @entity105 in 2006 by an official from the @entity108 , and he suggested in several fiery speeches that is was time for a serious investigation of how we got into the @entity113 in the first place . this was typical of @entity0 : the clear voice in the midst of the crowd , the man who says no when somebody needs to say it loudly . so what would it look like if , by some bizarre chance , @entity0 caught fire and became president ? he would certainly work hard for universal health care , which has been a passion of his . i 've heard him rail against the efforts of insurance and drug companies to undermine a system -- the single - payer system -- that has worked well throughout @entity134 for decades , reducing the costs of health care and actually improving it as well . he would not be @entity138 's best friend . indeed , he did n't support president @entity139 in his efforts to bail out the bankers , and wrote an open letter to @entity143 , the @entity12 secretary of the treasury , protesting that bailout . famously , on december 10 , 2010 , he gave an eight and a half hour speech on the floor of the @entity26 opposing the reinstatement of bush - era tax cuts , a vivid piece of rhetoric worth looking at closely by anyone who wants to understand @entity0 's views . he is a socialist , of course . how many @entity12 politicians have ever said this aloud ? and what does he really mean by that term ? @entity0 knows what he 's doing . by proclaiming himself a socialist , he is drawing attention to the fact that large corporations and banks , many with international bases , have controlled @entity12 public policy for a very long time , usually to the detriment of working people . and it 's working people who seem mostly to interest @entity0 . he has been one of only a few voices in the @entity26 in the past decade who has consistently pointed out that extreme right - wing factions funded by " millionaires and billionaires " ( one of @entity0 's favorite mantras ) have held sway over @entity12 politics for as long as anyone can recall . and this sway has usually operated to the detriment of people who actually repair roads , serve meals , deliver the mail , drive trucks and teach in schools . as president , @entity0 would also stand up against those who wish to deny climate change . indeed , @entity0 co-sponsored with @entity193 the @entity194 of 2007 . he has , for years , been a tireless advocate for the environment , aware of how its degradation has deeply hurt working people at home and abroad . but does he actually have the slightest chance of winning the @entity65 nomination ? and if he won it , could he defeat a @entity205 candidate with billionaires at his or her disposal ? he 's not crazy . in fact , he 's probably the sanest person in the presidential sweepstakes . but he ca n't win , and he knows that . what he will do , however , is move @entity212 on matters of importance to progressives : the restraining of @entity138 and large corporations , the scandal of how @entity12 allows its political campaigns to be funded and the welfare of working class @entity12 , who seems pathetically easy to persuade -- again and again -- to vote against their own economic interests . a steep climb looms before him . but i applaud @entity0 . i hope he soars and that his brave and commonsensical voice is heard .

( @entity1 ) @entity0 , my @entity3 senator and , indeed , a friend of many years , is now running for president*****1
he noted at his announcement ( with a familiar note of wise irony ) : " people should not underestimate me*****0
" to most @entity12 , of course , sen. @entity0 is only a name , if that*****0
he is barely known to the general public , which makes him a very long shot indeed to win election to the highest office in the nation*****1
those who follow politics a little more closely will possibly think of him as some left - wing kook that only the most liberal state in the union would ever dream of electing to the @entity26 , as we did in 2006*****1
let me add this , as someone who has followed him closely ( and with admiration ) for a long time : when people stop to listen to @entity0 , they realize that -- whether or not they agree with his ideas -- he is , without a question , an authentic voice who speaks without fear*****1
and nobody should underestimate him*****0
i remember when @entity0 was mayor of @entity41 ; it is the largest city in @entity3 ( which is n't saying much )*****1
i met him then , and his voice struck me as something not quite heard before*****0
he spoke with a throaty @entity47 accent , and he was @entity48 -- not your typical @entity49*****0
he served as mayor of this progressive town on the shores of @entity54 with remarkable energy for many years , listening closely to what people had to say , learning about politics at the local level , making a real difference in the daily lives of hard - working people*****1
he was never a @entity63 -- and is n't yet*****0
he 's a progressive , holding his seat in the @entity26 as an independent , although he votes with the @entity65 on major issues*****1
when @entity0 decided to run for @entity69 ' seat in the @entity70 in 1988 , many considered him a long shot*****1
i remember hosting a fundraising event at my farmhouse , where @entity0 held the floor for almost two hours , answering questions with a forthrightness that stunned those who had never encountered in person his fierce , funny , entertaining , passionate voice*****0
@entity0 won that seat , again and again*****0
make no mistake about this : @entity3 is n't just a rainbow - colored state full of ex-hippies and leftists in berets*****1
it 's an agricultural economy , and @entity0 has understood this well*****1
he has thoughtfully supported @entity3 's dairy - farming community over many years*****1
he has also been a strong supporter of @entity3 's hunting culture -- much to the annoyance of many on the left , who wonder why the @entity94 does n't attack him*****1
i was never prouder of @entity0 than during the run - up to the invasion of @entity98*****1
he was a singular and somewhat lonely voice in the @entity70 , strongly opposing the 2003 invasion*****0
he saw vividly that this was the worst foreign policy move in @entity12 history , one with endless repercussions*****0
he was especially outraged by the outing of former @entity106 spy @entity105 in 2006 by an official from the @entity108 , and he suggested in several fiery speeches that is was time for a serious investigation of how we got into the @entity113 in the first place*****0
this was typical of @entity0 : the clear voice in the midst of the crowd , the man who says no when somebody needs to say it loudly*****0
so what would it look like if , by some bizarre chance , @entity0 caught fire and became president ? he would certainly work hard for universal health care , which has been a passion of his*****0
i 've heard him rail against the efforts of insurance and drug companies to undermine a system -- the single - payer system -- that has worked well throughout @entity134 for decades , reducing the costs of health care and actually improving it as well*****0
he would not be @entity138 's best friend*****0
indeed , he did n't support president @entity139 in his efforts to bail out the bankers , and wrote an open letter to @entity143 , the @entity12 secretary of the treasury , protesting that bailout*****0
famously , on december 10 , 2010 , he gave an eight and a half hour speech on the floor of the @entity26 opposing the reinstatement of bush - era tax cuts , a vivid piece of rhetoric worth looking at closely by anyone who wants to understand @entity0 's views*****1
he is a socialist , of course*****0
how many @entity12 politicians have ever said this aloud ? and what does he really mean by that term ? @entity0 knows what he 's doing*****1
by proclaiming himself a socialist , he is drawing attention to the fact that large corporations and banks , many with international bases , have controlled @entity12 public policy for a very long time , usually to the detriment of working people*****0
and it 's working people who seem mostly to interest @entity0*****1
he has been one of only a few voices in the @entity26 in the past decade who has consistently pointed out that extreme right - wing factions funded by " millionaires and billionaires " ( one of @entity0 's favorite mantras ) have held sway over @entity12 politics for as long as anyone can recall*****1
and this sway has usually operated to the detriment of people who actually repair roads , serve meals , deliver the mail , drive trucks and teach in schools*****0
as president , @entity0 would also stand up against those who wish to deny climate change*****0
indeed , @entity0 co-sponsored with @entity193 the @entity194 of 2007*****0
he has , for years , been a tireless advocate for the environment , aware of how its degradation has deeply hurt working people at home and abroad*****0
but does he actually have the slightest chance of winning the @entity65 nomination ? and if he won it , could he defeat a @entity205 candidate with billionaires at his or her disposal ? he 's not crazy*****0
in fact , he 's probably the sanest person in the presidential sweepstakes*****0
but he ca n't win , and he knows that*****0
what he will do , however , is move @entity212 on matters of importance to progressives : the restraining of @entity138 and large corporations , the scandal of how @entity12 allows its political campaigns to be funded and the welfare of working class @entity12 , who seems pathetically easy to persuade -- again and again -- to vote against their own economic interests*****1
a steep climb looms before him*****0
but i applaud @entity0*****0
i hope he soars and that his brave and commonsensical voice is heard .*****0
