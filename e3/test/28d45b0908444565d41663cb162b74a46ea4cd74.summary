( @entity1 ) @entity1 's # @entity0 is an uplifting , revealing conversation about the way we present ourselves online . we want to see the real parts of life , the ones that do n't get a filter or a @entity10 post but are a part of our realities nonetheless . tag your favorite unscripted , unedited , un-perfected moments using @entity15 and see what others are sharing on @entity10 , @entity18 and the @entity19 . the @entity20 is always quick to dish out judgmental opinions , such as the body - hate people showed to singer p ! nk after she posted a photo of herself in a black dress she wore to a cancer benefit this past weekend ( which , if you ask us , was pretty fantastic , and she looked fabulous in it . ) as a woman with a lot of experience singing to her detractors , though , she knew exactly what to say and how to say it . and when it came to keeping her tongue firmly in cheek while she schooled people who had nothing better to do than be totally rude , she owned it . clearly , it 's not troubling p ! nk or her hubs , @entity45 ( who , by the way , is quite handsome himself , so clearly he has rad taste ) . not only did p ! nk 's response rally her fans , but they also started sharing their own photos of themselves post-pregnancy and embracing what p ! nk tells her daughter is her " squishiness . " postscript for the haters : we think you just racked up more fans for p ! nk . now go look in a mirror , and tell us -- are you perfect ?

tag your favorite unscripted , unedited , un-perfected moments using @entity15 and see what others are sharing on @entity10 , @entity18 and the @entity19*****0
the @entity20 is always quick to dish out judgmental opinions , such as the body - hate people showed to singer p ! nk after she posted a photo of herself in a black dress she wore to a cancer benefit this past weekend ( which , if you ask us , was pretty fantastic , and she looked fabulous in it*****1
) as a woman with a lot of experience singing to her detractors , though , she knew exactly what to say and how to say it*****0
and when it came to keeping her tongue firmly in cheek while she schooled people who had nothing better to do than be totally rude , she owned it*****0
clearly , it 's not troubling p ! nk or her hubs , @entity45 ( who , by the way , is quite handsome himself , so clearly he has rad taste )*****0
not only did p ! nk 's response rally her fans , but they also started sharing their own photos of themselves post-pregnancy and embracing what p ! nk tells her daughter is her " squishiness*****1
" postscript for the haters : we think you just racked up more fans for p ! nk*****0
now go look in a mirror , and tell us -- are you perfect ?*****0
