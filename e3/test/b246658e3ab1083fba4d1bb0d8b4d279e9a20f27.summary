( @entity1 ) if there was ever any doubt that the @entity6 administration 's @entity4 is an energy policy plan , not a carbon reduction plan , all you have to do is look at how they treat nuclear energy . nuclear is our largest source of carbon - free energy , generating over 60 % of our carbon - free electricity . surely president @entity6 's climate plan , allegedly aimed at reducing the @entity17 ' overall carbon emissions , would revitalize the nuclear industry , lead to increased plant construction and help meet aggressive carbon reduction targets . well , think again . @entity21 , the former head of @entity23 's @entity22 , said in 2013 that " continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity 's ability to avoid dangerous climate change . " yet wednesday , the @entity29 will celebrate @entity30 and promote its work to fend off climate change , while strategically ignoring its largest tool to cut carbon emissions -- nuclear energy -- as well as the warning of one of the administration 's favorite climate scientists . despite the fact that nuclear power is carbon - free , the @entity6 administration 's energy policy plan is biased against it . this bias is created by how @entity44 credits nuclear power in its models of both current emissions and plan implementation . @entity44 's modeling is divorced from reality . first , @entity44 's " @entity54 for the @entity55 " purports to depict the current state of the industry as the future would unfold without the @entity4 . this base case assumes no new nuclear construction and indicates the retirement of 96 of our 99 operating nuclear plants by 2050 . @entity44 's implementation modeling , " @entity62 -- @entity66 , " shows exactly the same situation : no new construction and 96 retirements by 2050 . in other words , @entity44 assumes that the nuclear industry is essentially phased out by 2050 . these assumptions are tremendously important because they determine how emission targets are set and what state actions will receive credit toward those targets . a group of @entity76 graduate students made this point to @entity44 at a public hearing last summer . using @entity44 's own data , the graduate students showed that @entity44 's energy policy plan creates incentives for states to shut down nuclear power plants and replace them with natural gas combined cycle plants . the students demonstrated that under this scenario , @entity44 's model shows emission reductions while real world emissions actually increase . president @entity6 's @entity44 has shifted its position on nuclear energy and hidden that policy shift in a model . for example , when @entity44 modeled the @entity98 - @entity97 bill in 2008 , the agency indicated 44 nuclear plants would need to be built by 2030 in order to achieve the carbon reductions mandated in the bill . @entity44 's modeling of the 2009 @entity106 bill showed the need to build 275 new nuclear plants by 2050 to meet the carbon reduction targets in the legislation . where did this policy shift come from ? at a recent hearing in the @entity114 , @entity115 , chairman of the @entity117 , told @entity118 that @entity44 looked at @entity120 's @entity119 when developing its so - called @entity4 and that @entity44 's plan adopts the same policy choices -- limited credit for either nuclear or hydropower -- both of which are carbon - free . thus , @entity44 is assuming legislative powers and is making policy choices that favor some forms of carbon - free energy over others . @entity118 did not give @entity44 the authority to make these choices , so instead they have hidden them in the modeling . for example , the same modeling that assumes the nuclear energy phaseout coincidentally shows robust development of renewables without any retirements between now and 2050 . this is a very favorable assumption albeit unlikely considering wind turbines and solar panels are commonly believed to last only 20 to 30 years before needing replacement . this anti-nuclear bias also is evident in @entity6 's recent executive order " @entity150 in the @entity151 , " which directs agencies to reduce their carbon emissions . even though existing nuclear plants generate carbon - free electricity , the executive order does not allow agencies to take credit for emission reduction from nuclear energy unless it is energy from small modular reactors . while i have long fought back on attempts for the federal government to tax carbon , i believe in an all - of - the - above energy strategy that provides our nation with energy security , and i have supported legislation that helps to clean the air . the administration says it shares these same interests , despite differing avenues to get there . the administration also believes in man - driven global warming , which should make nuclear energy its golden key . but the @entity4 and the president 's recent executive order demonstrate that the @entity6 administration is neither serious about reducing carbon emissions nor pursuing an all - of - the - above energy strategy . if you think this administration supports nuclear energy , think again .

( @entity1 ) if there was ever any doubt that the @entity6 administration 's @entity4 is an energy policy plan , not a carbon reduction plan , all you have to do is look at how they treat nuclear energy*****1
nuclear is our largest source of carbon - free energy , generating over 60 % of our carbon - free electricity*****1
surely president @entity6 's climate plan , allegedly aimed at reducing the @entity17 ' overall carbon emissions , would revitalize the nuclear industry , lead to increased plant construction and help meet aggressive carbon reduction targets*****1
well , think again*****0
@entity21 , the former head of @entity23 's @entity22 , said in 2013 that " continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity 's ability to avoid dangerous climate change*****1
" yet wednesday , the @entity29 will celebrate @entity30 and promote its work to fend off climate change , while strategically ignoring its largest tool to cut carbon emissions -- nuclear energy -- as well as the warning of one of the administration 's favorite climate scientists*****1
despite the fact that nuclear power is carbon - free , the @entity6 administration 's energy policy plan is biased against it*****1
this bias is created by how @entity44 credits nuclear power in its models of both current emissions and plan implementation*****1
@entity44 's modeling is divorced from reality*****0
first , @entity44 's " @entity54 for the @entity55 " purports to depict the current state of the industry as the future would unfold without the @entity4*****0
this base case assumes no new nuclear construction and indicates the retirement of 96 of our 99 operating nuclear plants by 2050*****0
@entity44 's implementation modeling , " @entity62 -- @entity66 , " shows exactly the same situation : no new construction and 96 retirements by 2050*****0
in other words , @entity44 assumes that the nuclear industry is essentially phased out by 2050*****0
these assumptions are tremendously important because they determine how emission targets are set and what state actions will receive credit toward those targets*****0
a group of @entity76 graduate students made this point to @entity44 at a public hearing last summer*****0
using @entity44 's own data , the graduate students showed that @entity44 's energy policy plan creates incentives for states to shut down nuclear power plants and replace them with natural gas combined cycle plants*****1
the students demonstrated that under this scenario , @entity44 's model shows emission reductions while real world emissions actually increase*****1
president @entity6 's @entity44 has shifted its position on nuclear energy and hidden that policy shift in a model*****1
for example , when @entity44 modeled the @entity98 - @entity97 bill in 2008 , the agency indicated 44 nuclear plants would need to be built by 2030 in order to achieve the carbon reductions mandated in the bill*****1
@entity44 's modeling of the 2009 @entity106 bill showed the need to build 275 new nuclear plants by 2050 to meet the carbon reduction targets in the legislation*****1
where did this policy shift come from ? at a recent hearing in the @entity114 , @entity115 , chairman of the @entity117 , told @entity118 that @entity44 looked at @entity120 's @entity119 when developing its so - called @entity4 and that @entity44 's plan adopts the same policy choices -- limited credit for either nuclear or hydropower -- both of which are carbon - free*****1
thus , @entity44 is assuming legislative powers and is making policy choices that favor some forms of carbon - free energy over others*****1
@entity118 did not give @entity44 the authority to make these choices , so instead they have hidden them in the modeling*****0
for example , the same modeling that assumes the nuclear energy phaseout coincidentally shows robust development of renewables without any retirements between now and 2050*****1
this is a very favorable assumption albeit unlikely considering wind turbines and solar panels are commonly believed to last only 20 to 30 years before needing replacement*****0
this anti-nuclear bias also is evident in @entity6 's recent executive order " @entity150 in the @entity151 , " which directs agencies to reduce their carbon emissions*****1
even though existing nuclear plants generate carbon - free electricity , the executive order does not allow agencies to take credit for emission reduction from nuclear energy unless it is energy from small modular reactors*****1
while i have long fought back on attempts for the federal government to tax carbon , i believe in an all - of - the - above energy strategy that provides our nation with energy security , and i have supported legislation that helps to clean the air*****1
the administration says it shares these same interests , despite differing avenues to get there*****0
the administration also believes in man - driven global warming , which should make nuclear energy its golden key*****1
but the @entity4 and the president 's recent executive order demonstrate that the @entity6 administration is neither serious about reducing carbon emissions nor pursuing an all - of - the - above energy strategy*****1
if you think this administration supports nuclear energy , think again .*****1
