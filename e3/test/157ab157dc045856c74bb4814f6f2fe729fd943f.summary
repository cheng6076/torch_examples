( @entity1 ) it did n't seem like a fair fight . on one side were hulking football players and pro wrestlers , competing as teams of two to eat as many pounds of steak as they could , combined , in one hour . on another was a lone 124 - pound mother of four . and sure enough , in the end , sunday 's contest at @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , was n't even close . @entity14 scarfed down three 72 - ounce steaks , three baked potatoes , three side salads , three rolls and three shrimp cocktails -- far outpacing her heftier rivals . that 's more than 13 pounds of steak , not counting the sides . and she did it all in 20 minutes , setting a record in the process . " we 've been doing this contest since 1960 , and in all that time we 've never had anybody come in to actually eat that many steaks at one time , " @entity31 , who co-owns the @entity10 , told @entity1 affiliate @entity32 . " so this is a first for us , and after 55 years of it , it 's a big deal . " in fairness , @entity37 is n't your typical 124 - pound person . the @entity42 native , 35 , is a professional on the competitive - eating circuit and once gobbled 363 chicken wings in 30 minutes . wearing shades and a black hoodie , @entity37 beat four other teams on sunday , including pairs of football players and pro wrestlers and two married competitive eaters . she also broke her own @entity10 record of two 72 - ounce steaks and sides , set last year , when she bested previous record - holder @entity57 . the landmark @entity10 restaurant offers its " 72 - ounce @entity63 " daily to anyone who can eat the massive steak , plus fixings , in under an hour . those who ca n't do so must pay $ 72 for the meal . @entity37 , who now lives in @entity66 , @entity67 , won $ 5,000 for her efforts . her feat will be submitted to @entity71 . but mostly , she just seemed pleased to enjoy a hearty meal on the house . " it 's free , so i 'm pretty happy about that , " she told @entity32 . " otherwise it would have cost me about 300 bucks . "
