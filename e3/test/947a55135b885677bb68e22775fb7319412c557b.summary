( @entity8 ) @entity5 police overnight thwarted a terrorist plot by a radicalized couple , a plan they suspect involved bombing a bicycle race near @entity3 , a @entity5 terrorism researcher briefed by investigators told @entity8 on thursday*****1
@entity5 prosecutors and police said that a man and a woman had been arrested in the @entity3 - area town of @entity16 on suspicion of planning a @entity18 - style attack , but the authorities did not explicitly reveal the target*****1
the suspected target , according to @entity22 , the terrorism researcher , was a race planned for friday*****1
the race loops around @entity25 and @entity3 on @entity26 each year , attracting large crowds of spectators along the cycle route*****1
prosecutor @entity30 said police recovered a pipe bomb ready to be used , 100 rounds of 9mm ammunition , a gun , the essential parts of a g - 3 assault rifle and 3 liters of hydrogen peroxide , which becomes explosive at high concentrations and has been used in multiple terror plots in the @entity41 , including the 2005 @entity43 bombings*****1
earlier thursday , @entity44 , a spokesman for the police of @entity46 , told @entity8 that the house and car of two individuals in @entity16 , in the forested hills west of @entity3 , had been searched*****1
as a result of what had been found , police had expanded their search along the @entity56 road on the bike race route , @entity44 said*****1
" we suspect that there was a @entity65 background , " said @entity58 , the interior minister for @entity59 , referring to ultra-fundamentalist interpretations of @entity61*****1
" police investigations at this stage indicate that we have thwarted an @entity69 attack*****1
" @entity22 , a journalist at @entity70 and terrorism researcher who first broke the story of the police raids , told @entity8 that a @entity5 couple of @entity76 descent -- @entity77 and @entity78 -- were under arrest*****1
he said the couple had ties to radical @entity69 circles in the @entity3 area*****1
neither is suspected of having direct links to the leadership of a terrorist group*****0
last week @entity5 police observed @entity89 moving in and out of a small forest near where he was living*****1
they suspect he was looking for a good place to hide a bomb along the bike race route , according to @entity98*****1
@entity22 said that according to @entity5 police documents , @entity5 police first became aware of the couple at the end of march when they went to a garden center near @entity3 to purchase hydrogen peroxide*****1
he said the store employee contacted police after becoming suspicious for several reasons*****0
the first was that the woman was covered in a full veil*****0
the second was that the couple claimed they wanted to buy hydrogen peroxide to clean their fish pond in their garden , but the amount they were ordering would have been enough to clean dozens of such ponds*****0
furthermore , after police thwarted a bomb plot by @entity5 extremists trained in the tribal areas of @entity125 to kill @entity127 servicemen in @entity5 in september 2007 with hydrogen peroxide - based bombs -- the so - called " @entity130 " plot -- @entity5 law had required such stores to report to police significant purchases of hydrogen peroxide*****1
according to @entity98 , after the tipoff , @entity5 investigators began trying to figure out who the couple were*****0
all they had to go on was the surveillance footage*****0
the woman was fully veiled and her male companion was blurry in the tape , so they did not immediately know who they were*****0
but in early to mid-april they were able to identify them and start surveillance to investigate the couple 's radical ties*****0
according to @entity98 , @entity5 police established that the couple had recently traveled to @entity156 , where they met with members of @entity159 , a radical pro-jihadist group linked to @entity160 in the @entity161*****1
@entity156 police had monitored the meeting in @entity156*****0
they also established that the couple had links to radicals who had gone to fight with @entity168 , @entity170 's @entity169 affiliate and they found the couple were in contact with a young radical islamist from @entity3 who had gone to fight in @entity176 at the end of last year and was recently killed*****0
the pipe bomb that was recovered by police appears to have similarities to devices built by @entity183 bombers @entity184*****1
@entity22 said the device recovered near @entity3 included nails as shrapnel*****0
the @entity18 bombers downloaded instructions from a recipe in @entity192 magazine , an online @entity194 language magazine put out by @entity170 in @entity195 , which has also been translated into @entity5 and other languages*****0
in august 2013 , the @entity161 security agency @entity197 revealed to @entity199 's intelligence and security committee that @entity192 has been " read by those involved in at least seven out of the 10 attacks planned within the @entity161 since its first issue ( in 2010 )*****0
we judge that it significantly enhanced the capability of individuals in four of these 10 attack plots*****0
" like other @entity210 countries , @entity5 is grappling with an unprecedented terrorist threat because of the high number of its citizens who have traveled to @entity176 and @entity215*****0
in recent years there has been growing concern over radicalization in @entity5 's large @entity76 diaspora community*****0
travel to @entity176 is particularly easy for individuals of @entity76 descent because @entity76 is the entry point for most foreign fighters traveling to @entity176*****0
according to @entity98 , almost 700 @entity5 are believed to have traveled to @entity176 and @entity215 , with up to 90 % joining @entity225*****0
one - third of these have returned to @entity5 and 70 to 80 have been killed in the fighting in @entity176 and @entity215*****0
there has only been one fatal terrorist attack in @entity5 since 9/11 -- the shooting death of two @entity127 airmen outside @entity232 by a lone - wolf radicalized @entity69 in march 2011*****1
