( @entity1 ) @entity0 is unique on the @entity3 calendar , a major point in the cycle of the religious year , and one that has always been able to resist the commercialization and culture warring that surrounds @entity8 . that 's in part because @entity0 is genuinely about how religious impulses , and patterns , can operate in ways that affect our lives . nevertheless , i 'm often surprised by how little people , even those supposedly within the @entity3 tradition , actually know about what is called @entity21 and its culmination on @entity24 . at a time when our culture is roiled by questions of identity and ethics ( and tolerance ) that have profound religious implications , it 's worth pausing to explore this crucial holiday -- and the awareness of the human condition , in all its sadness and glory , that it engenders . after all , @entity21 calls mostly to those who incline their minds and hearts in its direction with seriousness of intent . still , the fuss must puzzle those looking on , wondering what it all means . why do @entity50 make so much of this springtime week , and make so much of @entity0 weekend ? there is a phrase that many never come across , even among @entity50 : @entity54 . this refers to the three days of @entity0 that begin with @entity56 , proceed through @entity57 , and conclude with @entity24 . it 's definitely a progression , although the word itself -- triduum -- can refer to any three days of prayer . @entity54 has a kind of major prologue in @entity65 , the day when , by tradition , @entity66 celebrated the @entity68 with his disciples in the upper room in @entity71 on the night before he was crucified . the idea of @entity73 begins with this meal , which was a @entity75 meal . @entity66 , of course , was @entity77 , as were all his disciples . he was never trying to erase @entity79 and found a new religion . his work involved modifying and extending @entity79 in fresh ways . on @entity65 , @entity50 sometimes practice the washing of feet , recalling that @entity66 washed the very dusty feet of his disciples at the @entity68 as a way of demonstrating profound humility -- showing that he was himself a servant -- and modeling a kind of ideal behavior . @entity56 is n't , in fact , so good . it 's the day of the crucifixion , when @entity66 was scourged and beaten , forced to carry his cross to @entity94 , the " place of the skull , " and nailed to the cross itself for what must have been an agonizing death . the actual scene of the @entity102 varies from gospel to gospel , as do his last words , assembled into the so - called " seven last words " of @entity66 by adding up fragments from different gospels . some of these words are quotations , as when @entity66 asked @entity111 why he has abandoned him : this is a quote from the 22nd @entity113 , which opens : " my @entity111 , my @entity111 , why hast thou forsaken me ? " @entity56 is a day of death , sacrifice , displacement , fear . @entity57 is probably the least understood day of the @entity54 . it 's a passageway between the darkness of the crucifixion and the bright hope of @entity0 . this day occupies an anxious space in human experience , when the certain knowledge of something dreadful is n't quite erased -- ca n't be erased -- simply by hope . it 's a day of depression , a day of suspension . then comes @entity0 , with the aura of the resurrection . i 'm always moved by the deep symbolism of this mythic moment , when the body of @entity137 becomes what is called a " glorified body . " this was not , as i 've said elsewhere , the @entity141 , although that 's part of it , too . @entity144 implies a total transformation , something beyond the physical realm . it 's very important that almost nobody who encounters @entity66 after the resurrection can really recognize him , know him , or understand him as the same person who was with them before he was crucified . @entity0 embraces the great mystery of resurrection , with its promise of transformation -- a shift from one form to another , and a change that moves well beyond any literal understanding . the three days of @entity0 , the @entity162 , occur only once a year on the calendar . but the really interesting thing is that we all experience the pattern of the three days again and again . we find ourselves emptied out in small ways , nailed to our own trees in life , embarrassed or broken by life . it was the @entity172 who famously observed that life is suffering . @entity56 embodies the @entity3 version of that truth . @entity66 suffered in the way all of us must suffer . we must all die , perhaps less ignominiously but just as certainly . our friends and families must die . we all experience illness , loss , sadness , a loss of confidence , darkness . this is simply part of the human experience . we dive again and again into holy saturday , too -- a period of transition , when the bleakness of suffering is perhaps slightly behind us but nothing restorative seems in view . we know well this in - between time ; it 's an anxious passage , with only a glimmer on the horizon of potential hope . and we 've all been resurrected , again and again , perhaps in tiny ways . this is the joy of @entity0 , and it 's not something reserved for one day on the calendar . it 's there whenever we experience what @entity204 once called the " timeless moment , " which can only occur -- paradoxically -- in time itself . it 's a mystical point where timelessness intersects with time . i suspect we all experience the @entity162 frequently , sometimes more than once in a single day . but the ritual enactment of these three days of the @entity0 season reminds all of those who practice @entity3 -- and perhaps those who do n't -- that we should expect to move through darkness into light . it 's a pattern that describes a kind of spiritual progression . it 's good cause for celebration , too : and one that wo n't easily be co-opted by secular culture .

( @entity1 ) @entity0 is unique on the @entity3 calendar , a major point in the cycle of the religious year , and one that has always been able to resist the commercialization and culture warring that surrounds @entity8*****1
that 's in part because @entity0 is genuinely about how religious impulses , and patterns , can operate in ways that affect our lives*****1
nevertheless , i 'm often surprised by how little people , even those supposedly within the @entity3 tradition , actually know about what is called @entity21 and its culmination on @entity24*****0
at a time when our culture is roiled by questions of identity and ethics ( and tolerance ) that have profound religious implications , it 's worth pausing to explore this crucial holiday -- and the awareness of the human condition , in all its sadness and glory , that it engenders*****1
after all , @entity21 calls mostly to those who incline their minds and hearts in its direction with seriousness of intent*****0
still , the fuss must puzzle those looking on , wondering what it all means*****0
why do @entity50 make so much of this springtime week , and make so much of @entity0 weekend ? there is a phrase that many never come across , even among @entity50 : @entity54*****0
this refers to the three days of @entity0 that begin with @entity56 , proceed through @entity57 , and conclude with @entity24*****1
it 's definitely a progression , although the word itself -- triduum -- can refer to any three days of prayer*****1
@entity54 has a kind of major prologue in @entity65 , the day when , by tradition , @entity66 celebrated the @entity68 with his disciples in the upper room in @entity71 on the night before he was crucified*****0
the idea of @entity73 begins with this meal , which was a @entity75 meal*****0
@entity66 , of course , was @entity77 , as were all his disciples*****0
he was never trying to erase @entity79 and found a new religion*****0
his work involved modifying and extending @entity79 in fresh ways*****0
on @entity65 , @entity50 sometimes practice the washing of feet , recalling that @entity66 washed the very dusty feet of his disciples at the @entity68 as a way of demonstrating profound humility -- showing that he was himself a servant -- and modeling a kind of ideal behavior*****0
@entity56 is n't , in fact , so good*****0
it 's the day of the crucifixion , when @entity66 was scourged and beaten , forced to carry his cross to @entity94 , the " place of the skull , " and nailed to the cross itself for what must have been an agonizing death*****0
the actual scene of the @entity102 varies from gospel to gospel , as do his last words , assembled into the so - called " seven last words " of @entity66 by adding up fragments from different gospels*****0
some of these words are quotations , as when @entity66 asked @entity111 why he has abandoned him : this is a quote from the 22nd @entity113 , which opens : " my @entity111 , my @entity111 , why hast thou forsaken me ? " @entity56 is a day of death , sacrifice , displacement , fear*****0
@entity57 is probably the least understood day of the @entity54*****0
it 's a passageway between the darkness of the crucifixion and the bright hope of @entity0*****1
this day occupies an anxious space in human experience , when the certain knowledge of something dreadful is n't quite erased -- ca n't be erased -- simply by hope*****0
it 's a day of depression , a day of suspension*****0
then comes @entity0 , with the aura of the resurrection*****0
i 'm always moved by the deep symbolism of this mythic moment , when the body of @entity137 becomes what is called a " glorified body*****0
" this was not , as i 've said elsewhere , the @entity141 , although that 's part of it , too*****0
@entity144 implies a total transformation , something beyond the physical realm*****0
it 's very important that almost nobody who encounters @entity66 after the resurrection can really recognize him , know him , or understand him as the same person who was with them before he was crucified*****0
@entity0 embraces the great mystery of resurrection , with its promise of transformation -- a shift from one form to another , and a change that moves well beyond any literal understanding*****1
the three days of @entity0 , the @entity162 , occur only once a year on the calendar*****1
but the really interesting thing is that we all experience the pattern of the three days again and again*****0
we find ourselves emptied out in small ways , nailed to our own trees in life , embarrassed or broken by life*****0
it was the @entity172 who famously observed that life is suffering*****0
@entity56 embodies the @entity3 version of that truth*****0
@entity66 suffered in the way all of us must suffer*****0
we must all die , perhaps less ignominiously but just as certainly*****0
our friends and families must die*****0
we all experience illness , loss , sadness , a loss of confidence , darkness*****0
this is simply part of the human experience*****0
we dive again and again into holy saturday , too -- a period of transition , when the bleakness of suffering is perhaps slightly behind us but nothing restorative seems in view*****0
we know well this in - between time ; it 's an anxious passage , with only a glimmer on the horizon of potential hope*****0
and we 've all been resurrected , again and again , perhaps in tiny ways*****0
this is the joy of @entity0 , and it 's not something reserved for one day on the calendar*****1
it 's there whenever we experience what @entity204 once called the " timeless moment , " which can only occur -- paradoxically -- in time itself*****0
it 's a mystical point where timelessness intersects with time*****0
i suspect we all experience the @entity162 frequently , sometimes more than once in a single day*****0
but the ritual enactment of these three days of the @entity0 season reminds all of those who practice @entity3 -- and perhaps those who do n't -- that we should expect to move through darkness into light*****1
it 's a pattern that describes a kind of spiritual progression*****0
it 's good cause for celebration , too : and one that wo n't easily be co-opted by secular culture .*****1
