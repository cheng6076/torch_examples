( @entity3 ) ten years ago , a prosecutor in @entity1 , @entity2 , took a day off work and vanished . since then , the case of @entity6 has become one of the most intriguing and talked about missing persons stories in the country . investigators have taken dives to the bottom of lakes , dug up a grave , chased more than 300 reported sightings from @entity16 to @entity17 , dropped fliers over @entity19 , consulted a psychic , interviewed a member of the @entity21 and enlisted @entity23 technology . but no one has been able to find the veteran district attorney , who was 59 when he disappeared . when he went missing that friday morning on april 15 , 2005 , he left behind a live - in girlfriend , a beautiful and successful daughter and a bank account that was supposed to fund a fast - approaching retirement . his red @entity30 was found abandoned near a bridge on the @entity32 about 55 miles away from his home . months later his county - issued laptop and hard drive were found -- separately -- on the banks of the river , too damaged to read . as far as hard evidence goes , that 's about all police have . the best lead they got was the sighting of a woman who has not been identified , and information that he had searched online for ways to destroy a hard drive . what 's left is theory , speculation and a case that 's been cold almost from the beginning . " when a district attorney goes missing , you know , it 's pretty big . it 's going to catch people 's attention . a lot of people do n't have a large footprint . this guy had influential friends , he was well known , " said @entity64 , director of communications and case management for the @entity67 and @entity68 , or @entity69 . from the start , investigators have considered three possibilities : @entity6 committed suicide , fell victim to foul play or deliberately walked away . the prevailing theories have been suicide or walk - away , especially since 2009 , when a search of his @entity82 history on his home computer found that someone had been searching " how to fry a hard drive " and " water damage to a notebook computer . " @entity6 , a private and quiet man , was spotted with a woman who was not his girlfriend the day he went missing , and cigarette ash was found near his car , even though he was not a smoker . friends and colleagues recalled him being distant in the weeks that led up to his disappearance , and recounted his fascination with another law enforcement official from @entity100 who vanished in 1985 . @entity64 said that @entity69 has compared @entity6 's dna to unidentified bodies nine times since the database became available in 2009 , but so far , none has been a match . " even if he chose to make himself go missing , it sounds like something was terribly wrong that caused a drastic change in his life . there 's something wrong if he 's googled how to fry a hard drive . did he @entity82 it ? did someone else @entity82 it ? was he threatened ? did he do something and is trying to cover it up ? it 's not a normal thing to @entity82 that . " @entity123 , the former investigator who had been in charge of the investigation for several years , thinks that hard drive is the key to cracking the case . he said he 's still holding out hope that someday technology will allow investigators to recover the damaged data . " i think there is something out there . whether it 's evidence or a person , there 's something that could lead us to something , " he said . " in all honesty , somebody destroyed the hard drive and there was a reason . we have very few solid leads and the biggest one could be contained on that hard drive . " in 2011 , when former @entity152 defensive coordinator @entity151 was arrested and charged with sexually abusing boys , it was revealed that it was @entity6 who decided not to charge @entity151 when the first victim came forward in 1998 . @entity6 cited a lack of evidence . the intrigue already simmering in @entity6 's case exploded . sleuths desperately tried to find a link between the two cases , but investigators said there was no evidence that @entity6 's disappearance had anything to do with @entity151 's crimes . but some have stuck to the homicide theory , suggesting that @entity6 was an enemy of mob - like gangs in central @entity2 who were upset at his drug and corruption prosecutions . @entity176 , a forensic pathologist , said he considered writing a book about @entity6 , his ties to the @entity151 case , and whether it led to suicide . but , @entity176 said , he abandoned the book idea when it became clear there was not enough evidence . " i do n't think it 's a great stretch , " @entity176 said . " he was one of those guys with a very strong sense of justice and professional discipline and in light of what evolved and came to be disclosed -- i speak as a forensic pathologist who 's done so many suicides over the years and what can bring someone to that point . it 's pure conjecture , not based on any factual knowledge . " plus , @entity176 said , if it was a suicide , " i do n't understand how they never recovered the body . " @entity206 , a former district attorney in @entity207 , @entity2 , who was @entity6 's friend , has never accepted a suicide or walk - away theory . he believes his colleague was killed . @entity206 has doubts that , 10 years later , state police can recover from what he considers a bungled start to the case . " it did n't seem like there was any overall game plan that made sense in terms of a systematic investigation , " @entity206 said . " one of the things i 'd asked them to do from the first couple weeks is now impossible to do -- to do a hotel - motel canvas looking for the mystery woman seen with @entity6 and then match the names with photo ids which police have access to . " @entity206 said those records are now gone and his faith in finding @entity6 is dwindling . " i give it a 50 - 50 at best and only because i 'm an optimist and i hope that 's what will happen , " he said . " as a pessimist , maybe 1 in 10 that we 'll find him . " despite fresh eyes on the investigation when it was handed over to state authorities last year , the mystery woman has not been found . " @entity246 continue to chase down new leads and take a fresh look at old leads and we continue to hold out hope that something will break out in this case , " said @entity1 's district attorney @entity245 . " everybody , regardless of what position they held , deserves this kind of attention . in any missing persons case , he 's not the only one , we feel discouraged when we ca n't answer the questions for the family , but it does n't change our dedication to the case .

" the evidence is the same , " she said . @entity307 declined to comment , and investigators said they 've had trouble reaching her . " there is always a remote possibility that we might never have an answer , " said lt. @entity311 , who leads the investigation for the @entity246 after inheriting it last year .
