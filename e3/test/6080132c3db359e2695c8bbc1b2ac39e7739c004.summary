( @entity0 ) while the fight against @entity3 in @entity4 and @entity5 holds the world 's gaze , a simultaneous transformation is getting less attention : the deterioration of @entity10 . in an audio message released sunday , @entity10 confirmed that two of its leaders , known as @entity14 and @entity15 , were killed in @entity17 drone strikes in january in @entity18 , near the @entity21 - @entity20 border . @entity14 's real name was @entity23 , @entity10 said . he was a @entity20 who acted as the group 's liaison to the @entity20 @entity27 and was the deputy commander of @entity10 's @entity30 branch . ( @entity15 's real name was @entity32 , a @entity20 who oversaw suicide missions against @entity35 and @entity36 troops in @entity21 ) . @entity10 's @entity30 branch is relatively new , announced with some fanfare back in september by @entity10 's top leader , @entity38 . the creation of the terror group 's @entity30 branch was seen by some terrorism analysts as an attempt to steal some of the limelight from @entity3 , which is embroiled in a public dispute with @entity10 for leadership of the global jihad movement . the deaths of the two men continue the decimation of @entity10 's bench of leaders . on monday , in the southern @entity20 city of @entity55 , local @entity10 commander @entity53 was killed in a raid , said @entity57 , district inspector general of police . @entity59 - raised @entity58 , 39 , who was in charge of @entity10 's operations to attack the @entity62 , was killed in december in a @entity20 military operation . @entity65 - born @entity64 , who also played a planning role for @entity10 's operations , was arrested in @entity20 last year . the deaths of @entity32 and @entity23 underline the fact that there are almost no top leaders of @entity10 left except @entity38 . both @entity32 and @entity23 were @entity20 . this is an indicator of how @entity10 has become a largely @entity20 - focused group , increasingly able to do nothing of any significance outside of @entity20 or @entity21 . indeed , @entity10 has virtually no capacity to carry out attacks in the @entity62 . the last successful @entity10 attack in the @entity62 was the @entity79 transportation system bombings a decade ago . @entity10 is now reduced only to holding @entity35 hostages such as 73 - year - old aid worker @entity81 , who was kidnapped from his home in the @entity20 city of @entity84 on august 13 , 2011 . to be sure , @entity10 's @entity86 - based affiliate , @entity85 , or @entity85 , continues to pose a threat to @entity35 aviation . the group has built hard - to - detect bombs , which it has placed on @entity35 - bound flights . luckily , those bombs were faulty or were detected . the group also trained one of the gunmen who attacked the offices of the satirical magazine @entity95 in @entity96 in january , killing 12 , but it 's not clear if @entity85 had any direct role in planning this attack . meanwhile , @entity3 continues to attract @entity100 recruits and also inspire " homegrown " terrorists in the @entity62 , but the core @entity10 organization that killed almost 3,000 men , women and children on 9/11 is on life support . @entity10 's confirmation of the deaths of @entity32 and @entity23 is just one of the latest pieces of evidence for this assessment .

( @entity0 ) while the fight against @entity3 in @entity4 and @entity5 holds the world 's gaze , a simultaneous transformation is getting less attention : the deterioration of @entity10*****1
in an audio message released sunday , @entity10 confirmed that two of its leaders , known as @entity14 and @entity15 , were killed in @entity17 drone strikes in january in @entity18 , near the @entity21 - @entity20 border*****1
@entity14 's real name was @entity23 , @entity10 said*****1
he was a @entity20 who acted as the group 's liaison to the @entity20 @entity27 and was the deputy commander of @entity10 's @entity30 branch*****1
( @entity15 's real name was @entity32 , a @entity20 who oversaw suicide missions against @entity35 and @entity36 troops in @entity21 )*****0
@entity10 's @entity30 branch is relatively new , announced with some fanfare back in september by @entity10 's top leader , @entity38*****1
the creation of the terror group 's @entity30 branch was seen by some terrorism analysts as an attempt to steal some of the limelight from @entity3 , which is embroiled in a public dispute with @entity10 for leadership of the global jihad movement*****1
the deaths of the two men continue the decimation of @entity10 's bench of leaders*****1
on monday , in the southern @entity20 city of @entity55 , local @entity10 commander @entity53 was killed in a raid , said @entity57 , district inspector general of police*****1
@entity59 - raised @entity58 , 39 , who was in charge of @entity10 's operations to attack the @entity62 , was killed in december in a @entity20 military operation*****1
@entity65 - born @entity64 , who also played a planning role for @entity10 's operations , was arrested in @entity20 last year*****1
the deaths of @entity32 and @entity23 underline the fact that there are almost no top leaders of @entity10 left except @entity38*****1
both @entity32 and @entity23 were @entity20*****0
this is an indicator of how @entity10 has become a largely @entity20 - focused group , increasingly able to do nothing of any significance outside of @entity20 or @entity21*****1
indeed , @entity10 has virtually no capacity to carry out attacks in the @entity62*****1
the last successful @entity10 attack in the @entity62 was the @entity79 transportation system bombings a decade ago*****1
@entity10 is now reduced only to holding @entity35 hostages such as 73 - year - old aid worker @entity81 , who was kidnapped from his home in the @entity20 city of @entity84 on august 13 , 2011*****0
to be sure , @entity10 's @entity86 - based affiliate , @entity85 , or @entity85 , continues to pose a threat to @entity35 aviation*****1
the group has built hard - to - detect bombs , which it has placed on @entity35 - bound flights*****0
luckily , those bombs were faulty or were detected*****0
the group also trained one of the gunmen who attacked the offices of the satirical magazine @entity95 in @entity96 in january , killing 12 , but it 's not clear if @entity85 had any direct role in planning this attack*****1
meanwhile , @entity3 continues to attract @entity100 recruits and also inspire " homegrown " terrorists in the @entity62 , but the core @entity10 organization that killed almost 3,000 men , women and children on 9/11 is on life support*****1
@entity10 's confirmation of the deaths of @entity32 and @entity23 is just one of the latest pieces of evidence for this assessment .*****1
