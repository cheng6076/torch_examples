( @entity0 ) much of the world has been stunned by the huge increase of migrant deaths in the @entity4 this year , increasing the number of deaths at sea by a factor of 30 compared to the same time last year . almost all the deaths have occurred in the perilous central @entity4 crossing from @entity12 to @entity13 . the flows of migrants across the @entity4 are unlikely to stop -- @entity13 authorities estimate that up to 200,000 migrants in @entity12 are waiting to cross , following 170,000 refugees and migrants who arrived in @entity13 last year . these flows reflect a significant increase in the number of refugees and internally displaced people across the world , with a total estimate of 51.2 million people . the latest sinking has triggered some action in the @entity30 , which has unveiled a new ten - point action plan . the plan includes both deterrent mechanisms , such as efforts to capture and destroy vessels being used by smugglers and a rapid return system , but also an expansion of search - and - rescue programs and a proposed new voluntary resettlement scheme , though it is reported that this may only provide 5,000 spaces . but some @entity30 critics called for much tougher action to deter asylum seekers from making the risky journey . in a column published in the @entity52 's @entity51 newspaper just hours before the sinking , @entity48 declared : " it 's time to get @entity55 . bring on the gunships , force migrants back to their shores and burn the boats . " since then , @entity55 's prime minister , @entity61 , has also suggested that @entity62 adopt a tougher approach , saying , " the only way you can stop the deaths is to stop the people smuggling trade . the only way you can stop the deaths is in fact to stop the boats ... that 's why it is so urgent that the countries of @entity62 adopt very strong policies that will end the people smuggling trade across the @entity4 . " so what would it mean if the @entity30 did " get @entity55 " in its approach to asylum seekers ? and could @entity55 's current policy be used as a global solution , or at least one for asylum seekers trying to cross the @entity4 ? there were dramatic changes in @entity55 's immigration policy in 2013 , in the final months of the @entity90 government , led by @entity91 , which have been followed up and taken further by the current @entity93 national coalition government , led by @entity61 . in 2013 , with bipartisan support of those two major parties , mainland @entity55 was legally " excised " from the migration zone . it was done so that anyone arriving without a visa by boat would not be processed in @entity55 . all people who seek to enter @entity55 by sea , under the @entity102 , are no longer entitled to enter or stay in @entity55 while their refugee claims are processed . instead , they can be transported to detention facilities in @entity105 or @entity106 . alternatively , under a recent agreement , they can also agree to move to @entity109 . beyond this , the @entity61 government has also returned some boats to @entity113 without processing asylum seeker claims and , in two instances , to @entity116 following a very brief teleconference interview with the asylum seekers on board . that process was widely condemned by human rights advocates , given ongoing human rights abuses in @entity116 . that shift in policy under successive @entity90 and now the @entity126 governments in @entity55 has been chiefly designed as a deterrent : or , to use @entity61 's slogan , to " stop the boats " . so has it worked ? @entity131 , the numbers . if your sole criteria for success is the number of boats arriving in @entity55 each year , then " no advantage " ( meaning no asylum in @entity55 ) and " stop the boats " ( including the turning back of boats in international waters ) has worked . in 2013 , the @entity55 government reported that 300 boats with approximately 20,000 people on board arrived ; in 2014 , there were 0 . the current government has argued that its objective was to end the people smuggling trade -- and this required secrecy concerning the extent of its operations and turn - backs . so we do not know how many boats tried to enter @entity55 waters with asylum seekers . it also appears that no asylum seekers drowned in @entity55 waters during the 2013 - 2014 period . @entity61 explained the tactic of secrecy and turn - back in the following statement : " we are in a fierce contest with these people smugglers . and if we were at war , we would n't be giving out information that is of use to the enemy just because we might have an idle curiosity about it ourselves . " if we accept that these responses have worked , the question for @entity55 's government is whether it is sustainable , and whether it alleviating the flow of asylum seekers in the larger @entity181 . in sum , if this policy had to end due to its financial cost , has this policy been a " solution " ? the later years of the @entity188 administration saw both policy and budget departures from 2001 's " @entity191 , " which first introduced the excision zones and temporary protection visas as deterrents to asylum seekers . the @entity91 government abandoned temporary protection visas altogether but retained the excision zones ; this occurred in a period of heightened regional instability , leading to an increase of asylum seekers under the @entity91 era . the earlier @entity188 years of deterrence did not provide long - term solutions regarding the regional flow of asylum seekers . at present , in the greater @entity209 region , we may see potential regional pressures finding a way to @entity55 shores . the drowning of asylum seekers who sought passage via people smugglers appear to have increased , in particular , in the @entity217 . at the same time , the number of asylum seekers attempting to flee within the @entity181 has increased ; they are just not making it to @entity55 yet . on cost alone , it is hard to see @entity55 's approach to asylum seekers working or being affordable in @entity62 . for @entity55 , these short - term solutions have been extraordinarily expensive . a 2014 report by the @entity227 estimated that the @entity55 government may have spent as much as a $ 10 billion ( $ 7.72 billion ) on its detention policies since mid- 2007 -- and that each person in offshore detention costs the government as much as a $ 440,000 ( $ 343,000 ) . for comparison , we estimate that a similar model to respond to the 170,000 refugees and migrants who arrived last year in @entity13 would cost a $ 75 billion ( $ 58.5 billion ) . the @entity55 government 's ability to " stop the boats " -- or at least keep asylum seekers offshore -- depends on a number of factors , including tolerance from @entity113 , significant spending devoted to asylum deterrence and weathering international condemnation for violating the human rights of asylum seekers . the consequences of a policy of no asylum and no refuge in @entity55 for those who arrived by boat from july 2013 has been asylum seekers placed in situations where they are vulnerable to abuse , as we saw with the death of an @entity261 refugee in the @entity262 on @entity263 and sexual and physical assault of asylum seekers held at the @entity262 in @entity106 . the @entity55 government 's interception of asylum seekers attempting to reach @entity55 by boat , and then their relocation to @entity106 or @entity105 ( or perhaps @entity109 ) , does not remove or absolve the human rights obligations that @entity55 has to these populations . the operation to stop and return the boats , called " @entity276 " has been politically tumultuous for @entity55 's relationship with @entity113 . returning boats to international waters potentially violates @entity55 's obligation to international maritime law ; push - backs to @entity113 waters violates @entity113 's sovereignty and has placed people at great risk . in 2013 and 2014 , the @entity55 government sought the @entity116 government 's assistance to intercept those attempting to flee , and receive those who had already fled the country , at a time when that government was under investigation by the @entity294 for war crimes and crimes against humanity . as the situation in @entity62 illustrates , just because people are not making it to your shoreline to seek asylum does not mean people stop attempting asylum . in the short term , the " stop the boats " approach appears to be working for the @entity55 government . it is questionable whether this policy is financially or politically sustainable in the long term . it certainly has not ended people smuggling or people 's attempts to seek asylum in the wider @entity181 . @entity317 argues that the recent tragedy in @entity13 is not just about how to manage search and rescue operations , but requires consistent and long - term engagement with the root causes of refugee flows . this is a message that both the @entity30 and @entity55 should heed . @entity13 is a good example of the failure of trying to stop asylum seekers with deterrence . the @entity13 government ended its @entity331 search and rescue program last autumn , which was effective but was also costing the @entity13 government € 9.5 million per month . it was replaced by a much smaller @entity30 - run program , @entity335 , which has a smaller patrol area and a budget of less than a third that of @entity331 . the @entity339 , @entity340 , has noted that this new program is totally inadequate and " more geared to border control and policing the seas than to saving lives " . in @entity13 , both @entity331 and @entity335 were stemming an inevitable tide given the political instability in @entity347 . the migrants currently in @entity12 are in a perilous limbo , with a growing civil war having displaced more than 400,000 @entity12 and with @entity351 noting that the conflict and collapse of government authority has " eliminated any semblance of law and order from large parts of @entity12 . " second , such policies have significant legal implications . the @entity361 has ruled that these policies are legal as long as they take place outside of @entity55 's migration zone , an area that today includes all of @entity55 territory for the purposes of boat arrivals . by contrast , the @entity369 ruled in 2012 that efforts by the @entity13 government to return migrants intercepted at sea to @entity12 violated its legal obligations under the @entity375 because the migrants " were under the continuous and exclusive de jure and de facto control of the @entity13 authorities .

( @entity0 ) much of the world has been stunned by the huge increase of migrant deaths in the @entity4 this year , increasing the number of deaths at sea by a factor of 30 compared to the same time last year*****1
almost all the deaths have occurred in the perilous central @entity4 crossing from @entity12 to @entity13*****0
the flows of migrants across the @entity4 are unlikely to stop -- @entity13 authorities estimate that up to 200,000 migrants in @entity12 are waiting to cross , following 170,000 refugees and migrants who arrived in @entity13 last year*****1
these flows reflect a significant increase in the number of refugees and internally displaced people across the world , with a total estimate of 51.2 million people*****0
the latest sinking has triggered some action in the @entity30 , which has unveiled a new ten - point action plan*****0
the plan includes both deterrent mechanisms , such as efforts to capture and destroy vessels being used by smugglers and a rapid return system , but also an expansion of search - and - rescue programs and a proposed new voluntary resettlement scheme , though it is reported that this may only provide 5,000 spaces*****0

in 2013 , with bipartisan support of those two major parties , mainland @entity55 was legally " excised " from the migration zone*****0
it was done so that anyone arriving without a visa by boat would not be processed in @entity55*****0
all people who seek to enter @entity55 by sea , under the @entity102 , are no longer entitled to enter or stay in @entity55 while their refugee claims are processed*****1
instead , they can be transported to detention facilities in @entity105 or @entity106*****0
alternatively , under a recent agreement , they can also agree to move to @entity109*****0
beyond this , the @entity61 government has also returned some boats to @entity113 without processing asylum seeker claims and , in two instances , to @entity116 following a very brief teleconference interview with the asylum seekers on board*****0
that process was widely condemned by human rights advocates , given ongoing human rights abuses in @entity116*****0
that shift in policy under successive @entity90 and now the @entity126 governments in @entity55 has been chiefly designed as a deterrent : or , to use @entity61 's slogan , to " stop the boats "*****1
so has it worked ? @entity131 , the numbers*****0
if your sole criteria for success is the number of boats arriving in @entity55 each year , then " no advantage " ( meaning no asylum in @entity55 ) and " stop the boats " ( including the turning back of boats in international waters ) has worked*****1
in 2013 , the @entity55 government reported that 300 boats with approximately 20,000 people on board arrived ; in 2014 , there were 0*****1
the current government has argued that its objective was to end the people smuggling trade -- and this required secrecy concerning the extent of its operations and turn - backs*****0
so we do not know how many boats tried to enter @entity55 waters with asylum seekers*****1
it also appears that no asylum seekers drowned in @entity55 waters during the 2013 - 2014 period*****1
@entity61 explained the tactic of secrecy and turn - back in the following statement : " we are in a fierce contest with these people smugglers*****1
and if we were at war , we would n't be giving out information that is of use to the enemy just because we might have an idle curiosity about it ourselves*****0

on cost alone , it is hard to see @entity55 's approach to asylum seekers working or being affordable in @entity62*****1
for @entity55 , these short - term solutions have been extraordinarily expensive*****0
a 2014 report by the @entity227 estimated that the @entity55 government may have spent as much as a $ 10 billion ( $ 7.72 billion ) on its detention policies since mid- 2007 -- and that each person in offshore detention costs the government as much as a $ 440,000 ( $ 343,000 )*****0

the consequences of a policy of no asylum and no refuge in @entity55 for those who arrived by boat from july 2013 has been asylum seekers placed in situations where they are vulnerable to abuse , as we saw with the death of an @entity261 refugee in the @entity262 on @entity263 and sexual and physical assault of asylum seekers held at the @entity262 in @entity106*****0

as the situation in @entity62 illustrates , just because people are not making it to your shoreline to seek asylum does not mean people stop attempting asylum*****1
in the short term , the " stop the boats " approach appears to be working for the @entity55 government*****1
it is questionable whether this policy is financially or politically sustainable in the long term*****0
it certainly has not ended people smuggling or people 's attempts to seek asylum in the wider @entity181*****0
@entity317 argues that the recent tragedy in @entity13 is not just about how to manage search and rescue operations , but requires consistent and long - term engagement with the root causes of refugee flows*****0
this is a message that both the @entity30 and @entity55 should heed*****1
@entity13 is a good example of the failure of trying to stop asylum seekers with deterrence*****0
the @entity13 government ended its @entity331 search and rescue program last autumn , which was effective but was also costing the @entity13 government € 9.5 million per month*****0
it was replaced by a much smaller @entity30 - run program , @entity335 , which has a smaller patrol area and a budget of less than a third that of @entity331*****0
the @entity339 , @entity340 , has noted that this new program is totally inadequate and " more geared to border control and policing the seas than to saving lives "*****0
in @entity13 , both @entity331 and @entity335 were stemming an inevitable tide given the political instability in @entity347*****0
the migrants currently in @entity12 are in a perilous limbo , with a growing civil war having displaced more than 400,000 @entity12 and with @entity351 noting that the conflict and collapse of government authority has " eliminated any semblance of law and order from large parts of @entity12*****0
" second , such policies have significant legal implications*****0
the @entity361 has ruled that these policies are legal as long as they take place outside of @entity55 's migration zone , an area that today includes all of @entity55 territory for the purposes of boat arrivals*****0
by contrast , the @entity369 ruled in 2012 that efforts by the @entity13 government to return migrants intercepted at sea to @entity12 violated its legal obligations under the @entity375 because the migrants " were under the continuous and exclusive de jure and de facto control of the @entity13 authorities*****1
