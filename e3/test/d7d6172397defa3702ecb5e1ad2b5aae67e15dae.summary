@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) @entity4 star @entity3 looked on impassively wednesday as he was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole , a new low for a young man who once enjoyed a $ 40 million pro-football contract and now stands convicted in the 2013 murder of onetime friend @entity12 . @entity3 , 25 , appeared to shake his head " no " earlier as jurors in the @entity1 trial found him guilty of first - degree murder . he was also found guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition . " they got it wrong , " @entity3 said as he was being transported from the courthouse to a state prison , according to a law enforcement source close to the case . " i did n't do it . " at trial , the defense team described @entity12 , a former semi-pro football player , as @entity3 's " bluntmaster " -- his purveyor of marijuana -- and his future brother - in - law . but in victim impact statements , @entity12 's relatives portrayed him as a loving son and protective brother , as a man who rode his bike 10 miles to work and wore the same flip - flops for 12 years . " @entity12 was my only son , " his mother , @entity42 , told the court , without looking at @entity3 . " @entity12 was the man of the house . @entity12 was his sisters ' keeper . after my daughter @entity46 had her daughter , @entity12 became her keeper , too . " " i thank @entity49 every second for every day i spent with my son . the day i laid my son @entity12 to rest , i think my heart stopped beating for a moment . i felt like i wanted to go in that hole with my son @entity12 . " @entity12 was " the backbone of the family , " @entity57 said . she expressed regret she 'd never see him have a child and that she 'd never dance at his wedding . but she found forgiveness in her heart : " i forgive the hands of the people that had a hand in my son 's murder , either before or after . and i pray and hope that someday , everyone up there will forgive them also . " outside court , @entity76 district attorney @entity75 said of her ability to forgive : " i think it 's a tremendous compliment to her . " " as difficult as it is for people in the end , forgiveness is what it 's about , if people can bring themselves to that point , he said . what 's next for @entity3 ? of the defendant , @entity75 said : " @entity3 may have been a well - known @entity4 football player . however , in the end , the jury found that he was just a man who committed a brutal murder . " the fact that he was a professional athlete meant nothing in the end . he is a citizen who was held accountable by the jury for his depraved conduct . " asked whether @entity3 " gets it " after his murder conviction , @entity75 said : " i do n't know . i think when you 're taken away and they say , ' life in prison without parole ' ... there 's got to be some response . but i do n't know if he got it . " assistant district attorney @entity108 told the court moments before that sentence was imposed that @entity3 " committed an extremely cruel and atrocious killing . ... it was brutal . it was senseless . " judge @entity114 sentenced @entity3 " to a term of your natural life without the possibility of parole " for the first - degree murder conviction . @entity114 also sentenced him to between half a year and three years for unlawful possession of a firearm and one year , which he has already served , for unlawful possession of ammunition . as the verdict was read , the former standout tight end appeared upset but calm . he pursed his lips and took a deep breath as his lawyer @entity129 put his arm around him . he looked over to see his mother , @entity132 , and fianc√©e , @entity134 , weeping . @entity134 is the sister of the victim 's former girlfriend , @entity136 . @entity3 mouthed to them , " it 's ok .

" " to this day -- we just went through a three - month trial , and this is now two years later -- we still do n't know the exact time of @entity12 's murder , " one of the jurors said . " so i do n't know how @entity3 would have had that information two years ago . " the jurors said they learned about other pending cases against @entity3 , including a pair of murder counts , after rendering their verdict . asked how that made them feel , one juror said , " that we did the right thing .
