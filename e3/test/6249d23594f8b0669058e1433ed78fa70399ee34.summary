( @entity0 ) when @entity1 overran their villages near @entity3 in august 2014 , a small group of @entity5 , a @entity7 minority with a history reaching back more than 4,000 years , picked up weapons and formed their own militia : @entity11 -- " the @entity12 . " assyrians belong to the rapidly dwindling @entity15 population of @entity16 -- recent estimates from @entity18 , the largest @entity15 relief organization in northern @entity16 put the number as low as 300,000 compared with 1.5 million 20 years ago -- and many among them see the fight with @entity1 as a final battle for survival against the @entity25 . " ' ah , @entity5 -- i 've read about them in the @entity29 , ' is what many people say , " says @entity26 , a 25 - year - old electrical technician and member of @entity11 . " but we are not just history , we are still alive , we are still here . " the exodus of @entity15 from @entity16 started prior to @entity1 -- and the civil war in the mid- 2000s took an especially heavy toll . today , most @entity16 christians live in @entity40 areas in the north , which have been a relative haven of stability . and so far , the @entity44 have been taking heavy losses to defend @entity15 and @entity47 minorities against @entity1 . every night , the fighters hear the rumbling sound of coalition airplanes in the sky over @entity52 where they have their safe house just a few miles from the frontline . here they relax , patrol the empty streets of the village and try to hinder @entity1 suicide commandos from entering the near city of @entity60 where @entity61 says almost 100,000 refugees -- many of them @entity15 -- have found a temporary place to stay . so far , the militia has only assembled and trained 40 fighters . but @entity69 , manager of the digital media presence of the group , shows me his direct messages on @entity74 -- dozens of ex-soldiers , diaspora @entity5 or @entity15 activists from all over the world contact him and offer monetary support or their own presence on the frontline . " we have 200 people waiting right now , because we simply do not have enough weapons and training capacities , " @entity69 says . since they are still small and have no heavy weaponry , the @entity11 fighters say they coordinate closely with local @entity40 @entity85 commanders and share the same foxholes on the frontline . the fighters are a very mixed bunch . a young baker , carrying his large military dagger in an elegant sheath , says he brought his father when he enlisted . " but now , we see each other only rarely because he is in another unit of our group , " he says . " when i go on vacation , he goes to the field and the other way around . so every time we swap units , i wait for him , give him a quick hug and then leave back home . " right now , @entity1 is focused on other fronts -- the yellow fields of the @entity108 plains are quite safe for the mostly young fighters . but none of them thinks victory over @entity1 will be quick , nor that fighting will end immediately afterward . all they can do now is patrol the deserted alleys of @entity52 , making sure the wild dogs do n't take over the town and hope one day their relatives will be able to return .
