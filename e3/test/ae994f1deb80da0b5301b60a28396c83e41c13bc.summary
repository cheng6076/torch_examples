( @entity1 ) i would have done anything to get to @entity3 . it was worth the risk , the bad treatment and the fear , hard as that may be to believe . simply put , i have a better life now than i did before . but my journey across the @entity11 , like those of thousands of other migrants , was n't easy . here 's my story . it all started late last year when i lost my job in @entity17 . my work visa had expired , and i had nowhere else to go . i 'm @entity19 , and returning to @entity19 was n't an option -- going back means you either have to kill or be killed . but @entity19 do n't need visas to get into @entity23 , so @entity23 it was . i arrived in the country in december with an old dream in my mind : reaching @entity3 . while in @entity28 , i discovered many @entity30 pages about illegal smuggling from @entity23 to @entity32 by sea . all of them mentioned that @entity35 , a port city on the southern border , was the jump off point , so i made my way there . i met a @entity19 guy in a hotel in @entity35 who had already paid money to one smuggler and was planning to depart within a few days . he told me his smuggler was a decent man with a great reputation . reputation : it was a funny thing to hear for the first time , the thought that these people , who i always considered to be little more than criminals , were concerned about what people thought of them . but why would n't they be ? it 's a long - term business , and the @entity19 conflict is n't ending anytime soon . so i decided to meet the guy . we spoke about terms of payment and agreed on a fee of $ 6,500 . some of the money would be deposited into an insurance company , with the usual transaction fees . when i reached @entity32 the money would be released to the smuggler -- or , if i changed my mind , i 'd be able to get some of it back . " be ready all day , every day for the next few days , because you might receive the call to go , " the smuggler told me . one evening a few days later , i got the call and my journey began . they gathered 100 men and women in five buses and drove us to the smuggling point . it was far from @entity35 . we walked for 30 minutes , through rough terrain and orange farms near the beach , in darkness to avoid detection by police . the idea was to take us in three small boats to the main ship . i still remember an old lady , barely able to walk , with her two sons , marching along as fast as they could to try to reach the boats . they were told that if they did n't walk faster , the boat would leave without them . i asked myself so many time what could possibly drive a normal person to put himself and his family in this kind of danger . i decided that anyone with a past but no future was capable of doing crazy things . finally we reached the boat . it was just as the smuggler described . for three days we waited in the boat for two other parties of 100 people to join us before departing . we were in the middle of the @entity11 , far enough away from the surrounding countries to be in international waters . on the fourth day we started our journey with a mix of excitement and fear -- fear that this madness often ends in tragedy , ends with us as numbers piled on top of all the other unfortunate , nameless numbers who never made it to the other side . but there was no going back -- it 's a one - way ticket . we sailed for eight hours before the boat 's engine broke down . there were around 300 of us on board , and as the waves began to push us towards @entity133 the crew sent a distress signal , hoping to alert maybe a @entity137 or @entity138 boat , anyone who could help us . eventually our boat hit a cliff and got stuck . luckily , before long , a @entity133 coast guard ship arrived to rescue us and deport us back to @entity23 . @entity23 authorities fingerprinted and released us within a few hours . some of the people i had been traveling with said they were n't going to try to make the trip again . when they asked me what i planned to do , i told them i would do it again tomorrow if i could -- another journey through a sea where no prayer works , where no one is bigger than nature , where you can feel so small , no matter how big your dreams are . i 'd already lost everything . my family did n't know what i was doing , but i dreamed of being a human being who is treated like one . i was n't going to stop . so i called the smuggler the same night i was released , and said i wanted to get on the next ship out . two days later i received the call , and again i headed to a smuggling point . this time , they had a bigger boat -- a cargo ship , in fact , maybe 85 meters long or more . it took five days to get everyone on board the ship -- 391 of us in total , refugees from cities all over @entity19 . and for the first time , i began to feel like i was in jail , trapped in conditions no human should ever suffer . we lived in the hold . there were no mattresses or sheets , but we found some wooden planks to put our stuff on to keep it from getting wet . hundreds of migrants killed when boat capsizes for five days we had no food and little water . but at least it meant not having to make frequent trips to the " toilet , " if you could call it that , which was an old car tire covered with a piece of cloth . huge waves crashed against the ship from all angles and water leaked in from the ceiling as we slept on the cold metal floor of the ship , the smell of urine emanating from the corner . seven days in , despite the poor conditions , everything was going well and we were nearing the island - dotted seas near @entity218 . on the eleventh day , 200 miles off the coast of southern @entity32 our guides began to alert @entity32 authorities to our presence . we were adrift at sea , they told the authorities , with no captain or crew . and that was actually true -- we did n't have a registered pilot , just one guy who had worked on this ship before . an @entity232 ship -- working in conjunction with @entity234 , the joint @entity236 border patrol -- rescued us from our captain-less boat with the help of a scientific research boat from @entity240 . the rescue ship approached us but was unable to get close at first because the waves were so high . we knew we would have to wait some time before leaving our boat forever . the other refugees were waving their hands like children and then telling each other : " stop waving , they 've already seen us . " i was one of the last 10 people to be rescued from the boat . i can still see it like it was yesterday ; it was the rebirth of a new life . why migrants head to @entity11 they took us to @entity257 , on @entity258 , where we finally reached land a day later . when we arrived , the first thing the @entity32 authorities did was look after the urgent medical cases . there was a man who was poisoned by the drinking water on the boat , a few pregnant women and old people who needed medical attention . they took us to a refugee camp and the only thing anyone talked about was being fingerprinted . they were saying : " we did n't risk everything to be refugees . we are not going to give our fingerprints , even if they torture us . " later that night a @entity279 - @entity32 man told us not to worry : " they will not fingerprint you . " they would simply take us to different camps and we could leave from there . twelve days after it began , our journey to @entity3 was over . i spent two days in @entity258 before making my way first to @entity287 with two @entity19 guys who had become friends . we decided to go to @entity290 and went to @entity291 first and ended up in a city called @entity293 . i did n't know where my fellow travellers were heading , but i knew one thing : my dream of making it to @entity3 , no matter the cost and risk involved , had been achieved . it was worth it .

( @entity1 ) i would have done anything to get to @entity3*****0
it was worth the risk , the bad treatment and the fear , hard as that may be to believe*****0
simply put , i have a better life now than i did before*****0
but my journey across the @entity11 , like those of thousands of other migrants , was n't easy*****0
here 's my story*****0
it all started late last year when i lost my job in @entity17*****0
my work visa had expired , and i had nowhere else to go*****0
i 'm @entity19 , and returning to @entity19 was n't an option -- going back means you either have to kill or be killed*****0
but @entity19 do n't need visas to get into @entity23 , so @entity23 it was*****1
i arrived in the country in december with an old dream in my mind : reaching @entity3*****0
while in @entity28 , i discovered many @entity30 pages about illegal smuggling from @entity23 to @entity32 by sea*****1
all of them mentioned that @entity35 , a port city on the southern border , was the jump off point , so i made my way there*****0
i met a @entity19 guy in a hotel in @entity35 who had already paid money to one smuggler and was planning to depart within a few days*****1
he told me his smuggler was a decent man with a great reputation*****0
reputation : it was a funny thing to hear for the first time , the thought that these people , who i always considered to be little more than criminals , were concerned about what people thought of them*****0
but why would n't they be ? it 's a long - term business , and the @entity19 conflict is n't ending anytime soon*****1
so i decided to meet the guy*****0
we spoke about terms of payment and agreed on a fee of $ 6,500*****1
some of the money would be deposited into an insurance company , with the usual transaction fees*****0
when i reached @entity32 the money would be released to the smuggler -- or , if i changed my mind , i 'd be able to get some of it back*****1
" be ready all day , every day for the next few days , because you might receive the call to go , " the smuggler told me*****1
one evening a few days later , i got the call and my journey began*****0
they gathered 100 men and women in five buses and drove us to the smuggling point*****0
it was far from @entity35*****0
we walked for 30 minutes , through rough terrain and orange farms near the beach , in darkness to avoid detection by police*****0
the idea was to take us in three small boats to the main ship*****0
i still remember an old lady , barely able to walk , with her two sons , marching along as fast as they could to try to reach the boats*****0
they were told that if they did n't walk faster , the boat would leave without them*****0
i asked myself so many time what could possibly drive a normal person to put himself and his family in this kind of danger*****0
i decided that anyone with a past but no future was capable of doing crazy things*****0
finally we reached the boat*****0
it was just as the smuggler described*****0
for three days we waited in the boat for two other parties of 100 people to join us before departing*****0
we were in the middle of the @entity11 , far enough away from the surrounding countries to be in international waters*****0
on the fourth day we started our journey with a mix of excitement and fear -- fear that this madness often ends in tragedy , ends with us as numbers piled on top of all the other unfortunate , nameless numbers who never made it to the other side*****1
but there was no going back -- it 's a one - way ticket*****0
we sailed for eight hours before the boat 's engine broke down*****0
there were around 300 of us on board , and as the waves began to push us towards @entity133 the crew sent a distress signal , hoping to alert maybe a @entity137 or @entity138 boat , anyone who could help us*****0
eventually our boat hit a cliff and got stuck*****0
luckily , before long , a @entity133 coast guard ship arrived to rescue us and deport us back to @entity23*****0
@entity23 authorities fingerprinted and released us within a few hours*****0
some of the people i had been traveling with said they were n't going to try to make the trip again*****0
when they asked me what i planned to do , i told them i would do it again tomorrow if i could -- another journey through a sea where no prayer works , where no one is bigger than nature , where you can feel so small , no matter how big your dreams are*****0
i 'd already lost everything*****0
my family did n't know what i was doing , but i dreamed of being a human being who is treated like one*****0
i was n't going to stop*****0
so i called the smuggler the same night i was released , and said i wanted to get on the next ship out*****0
two days later i received the call , and again i headed to a smuggling point*****0
this time , they had a bigger boat -- a cargo ship , in fact , maybe 85 meters long or more*****0
it took five days to get everyone on board the ship -- 391 of us in total , refugees from cities all over @entity19*****0
and for the first time , i began to feel like i was in jail , trapped in conditions no human should ever suffer*****0
we lived in the hold*****0
there were no mattresses or sheets , but we found some wooden planks to put our stuff on to keep it from getting wet*****0
hundreds of migrants killed when boat capsizes for five days we had no food and little water*****0
but at least it meant not having to make frequent trips to the " toilet , " if you could call it that , which was an old car tire covered with a piece of cloth*****0
huge waves crashed against the ship from all angles and water leaked in from the ceiling as we slept on the cold metal floor of the ship , the smell of urine emanating from the corner*****0
seven days in , despite the poor conditions , everything was going well and we were nearing the island - dotted seas near @entity218*****0
on the eleventh day , 200 miles off the coast of southern @entity32 our guides began to alert @entity32 authorities to our presence*****1
we were adrift at sea , they told the authorities , with no captain or crew*****0
and that was actually true -- we did n't have a registered pilot , just one guy who had worked on this ship before*****0
an @entity232 ship -- working in conjunction with @entity234 , the joint @entity236 border patrol -- rescued us from our captain-less boat with the help of a scientific research boat from @entity240*****0
the rescue ship approached us but was unable to get close at first because the waves were so high*****0
we knew we would have to wait some time before leaving our boat forever*****0
the other refugees were waving their hands like children and then telling each other : " stop waving , they 've already seen us*****0
" i was one of the last 10 people to be rescued from the boat*****0
i can still see it like it was yesterday ; it was the rebirth of a new life*****0
why migrants head to @entity11 they took us to @entity257 , on @entity258 , where we finally reached land a day later*****0
when we arrived , the first thing the @entity32 authorities did was look after the urgent medical cases*****0
there was a man who was poisoned by the drinking water on the boat , a few pregnant women and old people who needed medical attention*****0
they took us to a refugee camp and the only thing anyone talked about was being fingerprinted*****0
they were saying : " we did n't risk everything to be refugees*****0
we are not going to give our fingerprints , even if they torture us*****0
" later that night a @entity279 - @entity32 man told us not to worry : " they will not fingerprint you*****1
" they would simply take us to different camps and we could leave from there*****0
twelve days after it began , our journey to @entity3 was over*****0
i spent two days in @entity258 before making my way first to @entity287 with two @entity19 guys who had become friends*****0
we decided to go to @entity290 and went to @entity291 first and ended up in a city called @entity293*****0
i did n't know where my fellow travellers were heading , but i knew one thing : my dream of making it to @entity3 , no matter the cost and risk involved , had been achieved*****0
it was worth it .*****0
