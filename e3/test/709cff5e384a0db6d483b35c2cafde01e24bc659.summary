( @entity1 ) @entity0 is in the headlines again . according to a @entity6 report thursday , @entity4 nuclear experts have told the @entity7 that @entity8 may already have as many as 20 nuclear warheads . and while that number may seem stunning , it is actually only part of a troubling story . the key takeaway from the latest assessment of @entity0 's nuclear capability is not in the actual number of warheads , but the type of warhead , as this gives a better clue to the future of the country 's weapons capabilities . true , the reported @entity4 estimate of 20 warheads is large enough to constitute a nuclear " arsenal . " however , this number is not actually significantly larger than conventional open source estimates of 10 to 15 warheads previously provided by @entity7 and other experts . the big takeaway from the report is instead the prediction that @entity0 could be in a position to double its arsenal by next year with weapons - grade uranium . if that assessment is correct , and @entity8 can indeed boost its nuclear stockpile by the end of this year to around 40 warheads by utilizing highly - enriched weapons - grade uranium , then the plutonium program that the @entity7 and members of the @entity42 talks had been negotiating over this past quarter century would suddenly seem trivial . after all , the plutonium program might be capable of spitting out maybe a few weapons worth of plutonium annually . this news could be much more serious . why ? for a start , it would mean that @entity0 's activities would undoubtedly meet the definition , if it had not already , of a runaway nuclear weapons program , with the potential to be fueled by a large supply of raw uranium buried in @entity0 's mines . in addition , while the plutonium program at @entity64 has a clear and detectable profile , the thousands of centrifuges that spin in a uranium - based program have no detectable heat signature or topographic profile , meaning you could store the stuff not just in the labyrinth of underground tunnels in @entity0 , undetectable from the sky , but in any large warehouse . @entity75 and @entity76 have tended to have a policy that leans toward downplaying @entity0 threats , at least when there is n't a full - fledged crisis going on . for example , the @entity7 downplayed @entity0 's missile threat until the country successfully put a satellite into orbit in december 2012 . and up until 2006 , no one thought the @entity88 regime would actually dare undertake a nuclear test . these new estimates could therefore be a timely reminder that we may have downplayed the threat @entity0 poses once again . but thursday 's report is n't the only troubling information we have had recently . just as concerning is the @entity98 commander 's assessment on @entity0 's missile capabilities . on april 7 , adm. @entity100 said during a press briefing that the @entity102 believed @entity8 's @entity104 intercontinental ballistic missile ( @entity105 ) is operational , with a warhead capacity . this statement is troubling for two reasons . first , @entity100 's statement , when combined with the latest @entity4 assessment , implies that @entity0 now not only has nuclear weapons , but the ability to miniaturize such weapons for a warhead that could be placed atop a missile with range rings extending to the @entity7 mainland . second , and just as importantly , @entity8 's advances in mobile icbm capabilities could end up undermining the state of stable deterrence that currently exists on the @entity122 . put simply , these capabilities could give @entity0 confidence that it is immune from any @entity7 counterstrikes . and if that ends up being the case , the @entity7 could find itself with a renewed headache in @entity130 -- and its carefully calibrated plans for its pivot to the region crumbling .

( @entity1 ) @entity0 is in the headlines again*****0
according to a @entity6 report thursday , @entity4 nuclear experts have told the @entity7 that @entity8 may already have as many as 20 nuclear warheads*****1
and while that number may seem stunning , it is actually only part of a troubling story*****0
the key takeaway from the latest assessment of @entity0 's nuclear capability is not in the actual number of warheads , but the type of warhead , as this gives a better clue to the future of the country 's weapons capabilities*****1
true , the reported @entity4 estimate of 20 warheads is large enough to constitute a nuclear " arsenal*****1
" however , this number is not actually significantly larger than conventional open source estimates of 10 to 15 warheads previously provided by @entity7 and other experts*****0
the big takeaway from the report is instead the prediction that @entity0 could be in a position to double its arsenal by next year with weapons - grade uranium*****0
if that assessment is correct , and @entity8 can indeed boost its nuclear stockpile by the end of this year to around 40 warheads by utilizing highly - enriched weapons - grade uranium , then the plutonium program that the @entity7 and members of the @entity42 talks had been negotiating over this past quarter century would suddenly seem trivial*****1
after all , the plutonium program might be capable of spitting out maybe a few weapons worth of plutonium annually*****0
this news could be much more serious*****0
why ? for a start , it would mean that @entity0 's activities would undoubtedly meet the definition , if it had not already , of a runaway nuclear weapons program , with the potential to be fueled by a large supply of raw uranium buried in @entity0 's mines*****1
in addition , while the plutonium program at @entity64 has a clear and detectable profile , the thousands of centrifuges that spin in a uranium - based program have no detectable heat signature or topographic profile , meaning you could store the stuff not just in the labyrinth of underground tunnels in @entity0 , undetectable from the sky , but in any large warehouse*****0
@entity75 and @entity76 have tended to have a policy that leans toward downplaying @entity0 threats , at least when there is n't a full - fledged crisis going on*****1
for example , the @entity7 downplayed @entity0 's missile threat until the country successfully put a satellite into orbit in december 2012*****0
and up until 2006 , no one thought the @entity88 regime would actually dare undertake a nuclear test*****0
these new estimates could therefore be a timely reminder that we may have downplayed the threat @entity0 poses once again*****0
but thursday 's report is n't the only troubling information we have had recently*****0
just as concerning is the @entity98 commander 's assessment on @entity0 's missile capabilities*****0
on april 7 , adm. @entity100 said during a press briefing that the @entity102 believed @entity8 's @entity104 intercontinental ballistic missile ( @entity105 ) is operational , with a warhead capacity*****0
this statement is troubling for two reasons*****0
first , @entity100 's statement , when combined with the latest @entity4 assessment , implies that @entity0 now not only has nuclear weapons , but the ability to miniaturize such weapons for a warhead that could be placed atop a missile with range rings extending to the @entity7 mainland*****1
second , and just as importantly , @entity8 's advances in mobile icbm capabilities could end up undermining the state of stable deterrence that currently exists on the @entity122*****0
put simply , these capabilities could give @entity0 confidence that it is immune from any @entity7 counterstrikes*****0
and if that ends up being the case , the @entity7 could find itself with a renewed headache in @entity130 -- and its carefully calibrated plans for its pivot to the region crumbling .*****0
