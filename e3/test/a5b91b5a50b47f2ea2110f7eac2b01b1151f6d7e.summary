( @entity5 ) the seventh installment of the " @entity9 " franchise , " " @entity8 7 " is sure to draw fans curious about how the film handles the real - life death of co-star @entity4 . but minus the off - screen tragedy , is " @entity11 " worth racing to the theater ? here 's what the critics are saying : @entity19 , @entity20 : " ' @entity11 ' is the best f&f by far , two hours of pure pow fueled by dedication and passionate heart . this one sticks with you . the usual flaws -- plot bumps , muscle acting , tweet - length dialogue -- fade in the face of the camaraderie on and off screen . finishing the film in @entity4 's honor clearly brought out the best in everyone . it 's bittersweet seeing @entity4 in action again . but it 's also a kick to watch him take the wheel or hang off a bus in @entity41 that happens to be hanging off a cliff . he feels at home . " @entity45 , @entity46 : " no one forks over 10 bucks to see one of these flicks for its logic . we go for the bananas demolition - derby mayhem . ' @entity11 ' delivers that with the direct visceral rush of an @entity55 . for two hours and change , we 're treated to a high - octane orgy of some of the most exhilarating stunts ever put on film , including one showstopper where @entity4 balances on an overturned bus that 's teetering on the edge of a cliff .
