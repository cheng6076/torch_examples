@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) a roller - coaster series of talks wrapped up thursday in @entity0 as a group of world powers known as the @entity7 reached a framework agreement with @entity9 over the country 's nuclear program*****1
the success of that agreement remains to be seen*****0
the parties have until the end to june to work out the details and put the plan to paper*****0
but the talks this week were , nevertheless , historic , particularly for the otherwise frozen @entity21 - @entity9 relationship*****1
but that 's not to say they were glamorous*****0
in fact , the negotiations this week provided a modern demonstration of diplomacy at its best , but also at its most hectic*****1
tucked amid the @entity28 on the shores of @entity30 , @entity0 is certainly one of the more scenic places to be trapped for talks -- a sort of @entity35 for the rich and famous*****0
but make no mistake : the site of these negotiations is also a gilded cage*****0
over the course of the eight - day round of talks , negotiators , their delegations , their security details and reporters were confined primarily to the immediate area around the five - star @entity48 , which played host to the negotiations*****1
this is n't the first time the hotel has provided a backdrop to a major diplomatic event*****0
in 1923 , the @entity57 was signed there , breaking up the @entity59 and defining the borders of modern - day @entity61*****0
more recently , the hotel has been a getaway for wealthy tourists and the occasional celebrity*****0

media give - and - take @entity95 made these comments to reporters who swarmed him during an afternoon walk along the lake thursday*****0
such ambushes were a frequent occurrence during the talks as reporters tried to supplement what little information was being circulated through official channels*****1
@entity84 was seen riding a bike on at least one occasion and dining at a nearby crepery on another , with both occasions prompting a cacophony of camera flashes*****0
reporters briefly followed @entity131 foreign minister @entity130 as he took a morning jog shortly after his arrival in @entity0 on sunday*****0
and @entity95 took several lakeside walks with advisers and security personnel , perhaps just hoping to take in the view , but certainly not making any effort to bypass the area where television cameras were staked out around the clock*****0

many journalists found refuge in the more comfortable downstairs bar , a shorter walk from the cameras and satellite trucks used around the clock by television reporters on a rolling deadline*****0

the announcement that an agreement had been reached sparked some chaos*****0
it was first sent out by the @entity280 delegation , which spread the word to its traveling press corps even as negotiators were still meeting*****0
as news began to get out , one @entity280 reporter ran frantically into the media area at the hotel , urging everyone to listen*****0
his message : there 's going to be an announcement*****0
there are buses waiting to take you to the auditorium of a nearby university where it will take place*****0
