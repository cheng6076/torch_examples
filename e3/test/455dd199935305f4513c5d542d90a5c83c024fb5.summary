( @entity1 ) would you want a tv program about your family history to include details of a distant , long - deceased relative who had owned slaves ? seriously , who in their right mind would want to be tarnished by the sins of an ancestor you had no connection to other than a remote bloodline ? i would n't , and neither did @entity16 , who lobbied producers of a @entity19 show , " finding your roots , " to remove any reference to his great - great - great grandfather @entity21 , a @entity22 slave owner in the mid- 1800 's , in an episode that looked at @entity16 's family history . ( @entity16 revealed @entity21 's name wednesday night . ) here 's the thing that might surprise many , given the tendency of the media to exploit any potentially scandalous material : the show 's producer , @entity32 professor @entity30 , apparently acquiesced to @entity16 's request , because when the episode aired in october 2014 , there was no mention of the star 's slave - owning ancestor . @entity16 's attempt to alter the content of the program only publicly became known a few days ago after @entity42 released hacked emails revealing an exchange between @entity30 and @entity46 chief @entity45 . when @entity30 asked how he should respond to @entity16 's request to delete the material , @entity45 responded , " all things being equal , i would definitely take it out . " and on tuesday , @entity16 , via @entity50 , admitted that he had urged @entity30 to excise any reference to his slave - owning relative . @entity16 explained , " i did n't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves . i was embarrassed . the very thought left a bad taste in my mouth . " now @entity30 has publicly denied that he made his decision about the content of the program based on @entity16 's request , but it seems likely that he did . after all , @entity16 noted as much in his @entity50 post , writing that @entity30 " agreed with me on the slave owner but made other choices i disagreed with . " and three other celebrities profiled on the series last season were shown to have been related to slave owners . so it 's unlikely that it was simply happenstance that it left out any reference to @entity16 's familial slave ownership connection . in any event , @entity19 has launched an internal review to determine if the show violated its own editorial standards . whatever the results of the review , @entity16 and @entity30 did the right thing . let 's be clear : " finding your roots " is not an investigative news show ; it 's an entertainment program . in fact , as @entity16 noted , much of the material is provided directly by the celebrity being profiled . it 's not " @entity95 " but more in the nature of a sophisticated profile of celebrities , using their marquee names to attract viewers . there 's not even a hint that @entity16 strong - armed the producers or made any type of threats against them if they included the information . in the emails between @entity30 and @entity45 , which they presumably believed at the time were confidential and would remain so , there was no mention of undue pressure by @entity16 . instead , @entity30 simply noted that @entity16 " asked us to edit out something . " after the emails were revealed , @entity30 issued a statement , saying , " ultimately , i maintain editorial control on all of my projects and , with my producers , decide what will make for the most compelling program . in the case of mr. @entity16 we focused on what we felt were the most interesting aspects of his ancestry -- including a @entity124 ancestor , a third great - grandfather who was an occult enthusiast , and his mother who marched for civil rights during the @entity129 of 1964 . " my view would be different if @entity16 had a history of uttering racist remarks or engaging in racist conduct . that would have made the information truly newsworthy . but instead we have a man known for championing progressive causes , which i 'm sure made him even more acutely sensitive that some on the right might possibly use this information against him in the future . perhaps that 's what @entity16 meant in his @entity50 post when he wrote that this information made him feel " vulnerable . " @entity16 has noted that he regrets asking @entity19 to not include information about his " distant relative . " that 's a nice gesture , but it was not needed . @entity16 had every right to ask for the information about a long - deceased distant relative to be left out of the show . and @entity19 had the choice to include it or leave it out . i applaud @entity19 for doing the right thing at a time when media outlets rarely show any restraint on the lives of people in the public eye .

whatever the results of the review , @entity16 and @entity30 did the right thing*****0
let 's be clear : " finding your roots " is not an investigative news show ; it 's an entertainment program*****0
in fact , as @entity16 noted , much of the material is provided directly by the celebrity being profiled*****0
it 's not " @entity95 " but more in the nature of a sophisticated profile of celebrities , using their marquee names to attract viewers*****0
there 's not even a hint that @entity16 strong - armed the producers or made any type of threats against them if they included the information*****1
