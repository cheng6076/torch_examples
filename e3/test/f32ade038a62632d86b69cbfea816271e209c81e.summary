( @entity2 ) fifty years ago in @entity3 , @entity1 prosecutors tried 22 former @entity5 soldiers at @entity6 in what remains the most famous @entity9 trial staged in @entity1 . at the time , @entity10 , the @entity1 - @entity11 attorney general of @entity12 , expressed the simple hope that " sooner or later , one of the accused would step forward and say : ' what took place -- it was horrific , i 'm sorry . ' then the entire world would exhale , as would all the survivors of those killed at @entity6 , and the air would be cleared . " sadly , @entity10 observed , " it has not been uttered , nor will it be . " the refusal of perpetrators to own up to their guilt remains one of the most disappointing aspects of @entity9 trials . @entity31 , whose conviction by a @entity34 court in 2011 established the precedent that has now made possible the trial of @entity37 , remained defiantly silent during his 18 - month trial , never so much as breathing a word of acknowledgment or remorse . over the years , some defendants have acknowledged knowing of the exterminations , but have insisted that they played no role . those who acknowledged participating in the killing insisted that they did so out of fear of life or limb . over the years , an extraordinary research effort was dedicated to exploring the claim that @entity5 men had engaged in extermination out of duress . the results were astonishing : investigators and historians failed to uncover so much as a single instance in which a @entity1 officer or nco had been executed or even severely punished for opting out of genocide . not one . these evasions and lies were often effective , as many @entity1 trials of @entity9 perpetrators ended either in light sentences or outright acquittal . and even when a trial ended in a conviction , what was missing was any sense of moral reckoning , an acknowledgment on the part of the accused of the perversity of genocide . @entity10 can now exhale . on april 21 , on the opening day of his trial in @entity78 , where he stands accused of complicity in the murder of 300,000 @entity11 during his service at @entity6 , the 93 - year - old @entity37 faced the court and acknowledged , " it is beyond question that i am morally complicit . this moral guilt i acknowledge here , before the victims , with regret and humility . " if nothing else comes from the trial , that statement alone justifies the undertaking . of course , in acknowledging his moral complicity , @entity95 fell short of confessing legal guilt . indeed , for years he has insisted in his innocence as a matter of law , arguing , in an interview with @entity104 in 2005 , that he had been no more than a " cog in the gears . " at @entity6 , @entity37 was responsible for inspecting the luggage of deportees to the camp -- most of whom were gassed within hours of their arrival -- for banknotes that would be carefully counted and sent to @entity114 . in performing this task , @entity37 insists that he never engaged in cruel , murderous or sadistic acts -- a claim that we can probably accept as true . but does this relieve him of criminal liability ? for decades @entity1 courts held that mere service as a concentration camp -- in the absence of evidence of a personal act of killing -- constituted no crime under @entity1 law . in 2011 , the @entity31 conviction changed that . in convicting @entity31 as an accessory to the murder of 28,000 @entity11 at the @entity136 death camp , the @entity34 court concluded that death camp guards , regardless of how they had conducted themselves , had to be accessories to murder , because that was their job . it was a crucial breakthrough , because it recognized that mass killing is not a personal act of evil but an exterminatory process . when it comes to factory - like genocide , guilt is not to be measured by acts of cruelty or nastiness ; guilt follows function . convicting under that theory was the great accomplishment of the @entity34 court . by this standard , @entity95 's truthful claim that he was no more than " a cog " constitutes an admission of guilt . this does not mean that @entity37 deserves the same measure of punishment as an @entity5 sadist . in fact , it 's not clear that he deserves any punishment besides the symbolic gesture of conviction . but without the court 's conviction , @entity95 's important acceptance of moral guilt will remain incomplete . the significance of @entity37 's trial can be measured in one final way . many have observed that it coincides with the 70th anniversary of the end of @entity183 but it also coincides with an anniversary of a different sort . april 24 marks the day that millions mourn the killing of hundreds of thousands of @entity188 by the @entity189 during @entity190 , an event many have described as genocide . and yet the @entity193 nation itself remains in denial of the mass killings that unfolded a hundred years ago . with that in mind , @entity37 's trial reminds us of other mass atrocities that still await their moment of moral and legal reckoning .

( @entity2 ) fifty years ago in @entity3 , @entity1 prosecutors tried 22 former @entity5 soldiers at @entity6 in what remains the most famous @entity9 trial staged in @entity1*****1
at the time , @entity10 , the @entity1 - @entity11 attorney general of @entity12 , expressed the simple hope that " sooner or later , one of the accused would step forward and say : ' what took place -- it was horrific , i 'm sorry*****0
' then the entire world would exhale , as would all the survivors of those killed at @entity6 , and the air would be cleared*****0
" sadly , @entity10 observed , " it has not been uttered , nor will it be*****0
" the refusal of perpetrators to own up to their guilt remains one of the most disappointing aspects of @entity9 trials*****0
@entity31 , whose conviction by a @entity34 court in 2011 established the precedent that has now made possible the trial of @entity37 , remained defiantly silent during his 18 - month trial , never so much as breathing a word of acknowledgment or remorse*****1
over the years , some defendants have acknowledged knowing of the exterminations , but have insisted that they played no role*****0
those who acknowledged participating in the killing insisted that they did so out of fear of life or limb*****0
over the years , an extraordinary research effort was dedicated to exploring the claim that @entity5 men had engaged in extermination out of duress*****0
the results were astonishing : investigators and historians failed to uncover so much as a single instance in which a @entity1 officer or nco had been executed or even severely punished for opting out of genocide*****0
not one*****0
these evasions and lies were often effective , as many @entity1 trials of @entity9 perpetrators ended either in light sentences or outright acquittal*****0
and even when a trial ended in a conviction , what was missing was any sense of moral reckoning , an acknowledgment on the part of the accused of the perversity of genocide*****1
@entity10 can now exhale*****0
on april 21 , on the opening day of his trial in @entity78 , where he stands accused of complicity in the murder of 300,000 @entity11 during his service at @entity6 , the 93 - year - old @entity37 faced the court and acknowledged , " it is beyond question that i am morally complicit*****1
this moral guilt i acknowledge here , before the victims , with regret and humility*****0
" if nothing else comes from the trial , that statement alone justifies the undertaking*****0
of course , in acknowledging his moral complicity , @entity95 fell short of confessing legal guilt*****0
indeed , for years he has insisted in his innocence as a matter of law , arguing , in an interview with @entity104 in 2005 , that he had been no more than a " cog in the gears*****0
" at @entity6 , @entity37 was responsible for inspecting the luggage of deportees to the camp -- most of whom were gassed within hours of their arrival -- for banknotes that would be carefully counted and sent to @entity114*****1
in performing this task , @entity37 insists that he never engaged in cruel , murderous or sadistic acts -- a claim that we can probably accept as true*****0
but does this relieve him of criminal liability ? for decades @entity1 courts held that mere service as a concentration camp -- in the absence of evidence of a personal act of killing -- constituted no crime under @entity1 law*****0
in 2011 , the @entity31 conviction changed that*****0
in convicting @entity31 as an accessory to the murder of 28,000 @entity11 at the @entity136 death camp , the @entity34 court concluded that death camp guards , regardless of how they had conducted themselves , had to be accessories to murder , because that was their job*****0
it was a crucial breakthrough , because it recognized that mass killing is not a personal act of evil but an exterminatory process*****0
when it comes to factory - like genocide , guilt is not to be measured by acts of cruelty or nastiness ; guilt follows function*****0
convicting under that theory was the great accomplishment of the @entity34 court*****0
by this standard , @entity95 's truthful claim that he was no more than " a cog " constitutes an admission of guilt*****0
this does not mean that @entity37 deserves the same measure of punishment as an @entity5 sadist*****0
in fact , it 's not clear that he deserves any punishment besides the symbolic gesture of conviction*****0
but without the court 's conviction , @entity95 's important acceptance of moral guilt will remain incomplete*****0
the significance of @entity37 's trial can be measured in one final way*****1
many have observed that it coincides with the 70th anniversary of the end of @entity183 but it also coincides with an anniversary of a different sort*****0
april 24 marks the day that millions mourn the killing of hundreds of thousands of @entity188 by the @entity189 during @entity190 , an event many have described as genocide*****0
and yet the @entity193 nation itself remains in denial of the mass killings that unfolded a hundred years ago*****0
with that in mind , @entity37 's trial reminds us of other mass atrocities that still await their moment of moral and legal reckoning .*****1
