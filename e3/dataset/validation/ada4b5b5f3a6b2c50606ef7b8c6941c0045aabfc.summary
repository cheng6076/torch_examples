( @entity1 ) @entity0 is a young company with a big dream : changing the way we interact with electronic devices*****1
their technology creates tactile three - dimensional shapes literally out of thin air , using ultrasound*****1
the company 's tagline says it all : " feeling without touching*****0
" through an emission of sound waves , sensations are projected through the air and to the user*****1
changes in air pressure are perceived as suspended tactile surfaces , creating invisible -- but tangible -- interfaces*****1
this already sounds quite intriguing , but paired with another rising technology it has the potential to become a game changer*****0
the rising tide of virtual reality seems unstoppable : @entity29 's @entity28 and @entity30 are leading the pack , but several other companies are readying devices in a field that could shake the foundations of electronic entertainment*****1
but even though it is incredibly convincing , virtual reality completely bypasses the sense of touch : applying @entity0 ' technology to it would allow users to not just see the virtual world projected in front of their eyes , but to touch it as well*****1
@entity47 , @entity0 ' cto , sees potential in the merging of these technologies : " the ability to put on your virtual reality goggles and not just explore visually and through your headphones , but also touch what you can see , is a really exciting possibility , " he told @entity1 's @entity56*****1

it 's really all of the information that you get from the sense of touch*****0
what you 're feeling , what sort of pressure , the tactile sensation given by an object or surface*****1
you also know where your limbs are and how they 're moving , all from the sense of touch*****0
