( @entity1 ) it 's the kind of thing you see in movies , like @entity6 's role in " @entity7 " or @entity9 's " @entity8 . " but , in real life , it 's hard to swallow the idea of a single person being stranded at sea for days , weeks , if not months and somehow living to talk about it . miracles do happen , though , and not just in @entity17 . we 're not talking about people who float aimlessly or run aground after running out of gas or being let down by faltering winds only to be picked up a few hours later by the @entity22 . much rarer are cases in which individuals become lost at sea long enough that they run out of whatever food and drinking water they 'd brought aboard , if any . in order to survive , they ca n't bank on technology or the proximity of a nearby city , town or boat -- but instead must rely on ingenuity , resourcefulness and luck . it 's hard to say how many of these types of stories end sadly , with a sailor dying at sea , except that it is a much higher number than those that end in rescues . such happy endings do occur -- given what rescue agencies have reported and assuming you believe what any sole survivor says , a big qualifier since typically no one else can prove or refute their accounts . below are a few recent examples : @entity60 says that he set off on his 35 - foot sailboat from @entity62 in late january . he headed into the @entity63 looking for a good spot to catch fish . and then everything -- his boat , his life -- turned upside down . rescued man says he is ' utterly thankful ' not only did his boat capsize , but its mast broke , @entity60 said . and so , too , did his shoulder . he bought time by rationing water , then collecting fresh water in a bucket . as to food , @entity60 says he used laundry to trap and scoop up fish . and he rigged a makeshift mast and sail . but , @entity60 said , " it took so long . it moved so slowly . " his sailboat would capsize two more times before crew members on a @entity88 - flagged container ship , the @entity89 , spotted @entity60 about 200 miles off the @entity91 coast on thursday . after their reunion , his father greeted him with a hug and an admission every parent dreads . " i thought i lost you . " @entity99 says his journey began in @entity101 , a port on @entity103 's @entity102 , in late 2012 . the exact date is up for debate -- he says he set off in december , locals say it was november . but what 's not in doubt is that , after he left , he disappeared . until january 2013 . that 's when @entity99 interacted with humans once again , thousands of miles away on a remote atoll in the @entity113 . @entity114 recounts how he survived over a year adrift in @entity102 what was supposed to be a one - day trip , he says , turned into an arduous odyssey across the @entity118 , one that saw him lose his fishing companion and tested his will and ability to survive . his nightmare began when winds blew the pair off course . then a storm hit causing their boat , which was about three people long and one wide , to lose its engine and use of its radio communication and gps systems . four weeks in , @entity99 said his partner -- 23 - year - old @entity134 , according to the boat 's owner -- died because he refused to eat raw birds . the days , weeks and months ran together after that . @entity99 says he drank rainwater and , when there was n't any available , his own urine . he ate sea turtles . then , after 13 or 14 months adrift , he and his small , heavily damaged boat arrived on the @entity144 , about a 22 - hour boat ride from the @entity113 capital of @entity147 . the atoll has one phone line , no internet service and a few residents , two of whom @entity99 spotted and shouted to after spending a night in the woods . the @entity156 native told @entity1 that his faith in @entity158 helped him survive .

( @entity1 ) it 's the kind of thing you see in movies , like @entity6 's role in " @entity7 " or @entity9 's " @entity8*****0
" but , in real life , it 's hard to swallow the idea of a single person being stranded at sea for days , weeks , if not months and somehow living to talk about it*****1
miracles do happen , though , and not just in @entity17*****0
we 're not talking about people who float aimlessly or run aground after running out of gas or being let down by faltering winds only to be picked up a few hours later by the @entity22*****0
much rarer are cases in which individuals become lost at sea long enough that they run out of whatever food and drinking water they 'd brought aboard , if any*****0
in order to survive , they ca n't bank on technology or the proximity of a nearby city , town or boat -- but instead must rely on ingenuity , resourcefulness and luck*****0
it 's hard to say how many of these types of stories end sadly , with a sailor dying at sea , except that it is a much higher number than those that end in rescues*****1
such happy endings do occur -- given what rescue agencies have reported and assuming you believe what any sole survivor says , a big qualifier since typically no one else can prove or refute their accounts*****1
below are a few recent examples : @entity60 says that he set off on his 35 - foot sailboat from @entity62 in late january*****0
he headed into the @entity63 looking for a good spot to catch fish*****0
and then everything -- his boat , his life -- turned upside down*****0
rescued man says he is ' utterly thankful ' not only did his boat capsize , but its mast broke , @entity60 said*****1
and so , too , did his shoulder*****0
he bought time by rationing water , then collecting fresh water in a bucket*****0
as to food , @entity60 says he used laundry to trap and scoop up fish*****0
and he rigged a makeshift mast and sail*****0
but , @entity60 said , " it took so long*****0
it moved so slowly*****0
" his sailboat would capsize two more times before crew members on a @entity88 - flagged container ship , the @entity89 , spotted @entity60 about 200 miles off the @entity91 coast on thursday*****0
after their reunion , his father greeted him with a hug and an admission every parent dreads*****0
" i thought i lost you*****0
" @entity99 says his journey began in @entity101 , a port on @entity103 's @entity102 , in late 2012*****0
the exact date is up for debate -- he says he set off in december , locals say it was november*****0
but what 's not in doubt is that , after he left , he disappeared*****0
until january 2013*****0
that 's when @entity99 interacted with humans once again , thousands of miles away on a remote atoll in the @entity113*****0
@entity114 recounts how he survived over a year adrift in @entity102 what was supposed to be a one - day trip , he says , turned into an arduous odyssey across the @entity118 , one that saw him lose his fishing companion and tested his will and ability to survive*****0
his nightmare began when winds blew the pair off course*****0
then a storm hit causing their boat , which was about three people long and one wide , to lose its engine and use of its radio communication and gps systems*****0
four weeks in , @entity99 said his partner -- 23 - year - old @entity134 , according to the boat 's owner -- died because he refused to eat raw birds*****0
the days , weeks and months ran together after that*****0
@entity99 says he drank rainwater and , when there was n't any available , his own urine*****0
he ate sea turtles*****0
then , after 13 or 14 months adrift , he and his small , heavily damaged boat arrived on the @entity144 , about a 22 - hour boat ride from the @entity113 capital of @entity147*****0
the atoll has one phone line , no internet service and a few residents , two of whom @entity99 spotted and shouted to after spending a night in the woods*****0
the @entity156 native told @entity1 that his faith in @entity158 helped him survive*****0
" i thought , ' i am going to get out , " he said*****0
" get out , get out , get out*****0
" some in their late 60s might relax in their retirement , reining it in a few notches as life slows down*****0
and if you live in @entity167 , there 's even more reason to take it easy*****0
the thing is : @entity170 is n't one of those people*****0
he 's a fisherman*****0
the sea is both his life and livelihood , his son , @entity173 , told @entity1*****0
and he 's tough , with his son jokingly comparing him to @entity178*****0
still , even the hardiest fishermen would have been tested by what @entity170 went through after setting off around last @entity182 solo from the @entity184 island of @entity185*****0
son vindicated as father rescued after 12 days at sea after bad weather hit , @entity170 told @entity1 affiliate @entity192 / @entity191 that his 25 - foot sailboat went " backwards all night long*****1
" at one point , a huge wave struck -- pushing his mast into the water and him as well*****0
the 67 - year - old used a rope to pull himself back in*****0
but his boat could n't be rescued so easily , leaving him at the mercy of the current*****0
a distress call went out , prompting a search that would cover 12,000 square miles*****0
when a @entity22 official told him the search was being called off december 1 , @entity205 responded , " i do n't feel like he 's dead*****0
i do n't feel it*****0
" he was right*****0
twelve days after that first distress call , @entity170 was picked up about 64 miles ( 103 kilometers ) south of @entity210 " weak , hungry and dehydrated " and -- most importantly -- alive*****0
the veteran fisherman headed back to shore only after getting assurances his damaged boat would come with him*****0
in february 2012 , two friends asked 18 - year - old @entity215 whether he wanted to tag along on an overnight fishing expedition*****0
he said yes , and the three set off from the @entity220 town of @entity221 on a small boat , @entity215 's mother , @entity217 , recalled*****0
things started out well , by all accounts*****0
the three caught plenty of fish*****0
then , their boat 's engine died without warning*****0
and , with no tools and scant navigational experience , the trio did n't know what to do , according to @entity215 's mother*****0
mother calls @entity220 teen 's return ' a miracle ' @entity240 ate raw fish and drank rainwater as currents swept his boat , the @entity245 , further and further from the coast and into the @entity118*****0
somewhere along the way , his two companions died*****0
it 's not clear exactly how , with @entity251 rear*****0
adm. @entity252 saying @entity215 threw their bodies into the sea " because they had become badly decomposed*****0
" some 26 days after and nearly 600 miles away from where the journey began , fishermen spotted the tiny vessel north of the @entity261*****0
the @entity251 navy came in and picked up the teenage survivor , who 'd lost 20 pounds and showed " severe signs of dehydration and lack of nutrition , " according to @entity252*****0
he returned home to loved ones eager to embrace him , but mindful of giving him time to process the ordeal*****0
" for us , this is an opportunity to get closer as a family , " his mother said by phone , " to be more understanding and loving*****0
" sometimes one does n't have to be in the ocean for weeks to have his or her life imperiled*****0
sometimes people do n't have to set off by boat to have the sea challenge them to the end*****0
for proof , look no further than @entity287*****0
60 - year - old man waves red flag to alert rescuers he was at home on march 11 , 2011 , when a massive 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck 231 miles northeast of @entity294*****1
a devastating tsunami followed , its 30 - foot waves ravaging cities and towns and damaging several nuclear reactors*****0
by the time it had run the course , nearly 16,000 people were dead*****0
it 's a miracle @entity304 was n't one of them*****0
shortly after the quake , he and his wife had gone to collect some belongings when the tsunami slammed their hometown of @entity313*****0
his home was one of the tens of thousands destroyed by the the huge , powerful tsunami wave*****0
" i was saved by holding onto the roof , " the 60 - year - old said , according to @entity318*****0
" but my wife was swept away*****0
' more than two days later , video showed @entity304 barely visible amid heaps of splintered wood , shattered homes and other debris floating more than nine miles ( 15 kilometers ) out to sea*****1
he was waving a self - made red flag*****0
after being spotted by crew aboard a @entity330 destroyer and picked up in a smaller rescue boat , he took a drink offered to him and burst into tears , @entity318 reported*****0
@entity304 told his rescuers , " i thought today was the last day of my life*****0
