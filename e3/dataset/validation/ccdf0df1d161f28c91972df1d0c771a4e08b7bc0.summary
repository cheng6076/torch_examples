( @entity0 ) tuesday , april 14 , is @entity1*****1
here 's the announcement presidential candidate @entity2 should make : " today in @entity5 , women earn on average 77 cents for every dollar men earn*****1
and the gap is even greater for women of color*****1
that 's unconscionable*****0
as president , my top priority will be fixing inequality and ensuring that 100 % of the population is paid 100 % of what they 're worth*****0
and so , i 'm announcing that if elected president , i will take a 23 % pay cut , equivalent to the current gender wage gap , to stand in solidarity with working women in @entity5*****1
and i wo n't take a raise until every woman in @entity5 gets a raise , too*****0
" april 14 was n't just chosen at random as @entity1*****1
it 's based on a calculation : for women to make the same amount of money that men made in 2014 , they 'd have to work until april 14 , 2015*****1
a woman on average loses $ 431,000 in pay over the course of a 40 - year career*****0
merely closing the gender wage gap would pull half of working single moms out of poverty*****1
and at a time where @entity42 are still , bizarrely , trumpeting more tax breaks for business and the rich to stimulate the economy , closing the pay gap would put money in the pockets of working people who would actually spend and stimulate real growth*****1
the new women warriors : reviving the fight for equal rights so here 's the perfect opportunity for @entity2 to put her money where her mouth is , literally*****1
in her campaign launch and personal rebrand , @entity58 is clearly trying to portray herself as a woman of the people , a populist fighter for the middle class*****0
" @entity64 need a champion , " @entity58 said in her campaign launch video , " and i want to be that champion*****0
" @entity58 has deftly put her finger in the wind and sensed the winds of populism blowing through @entity5*****0
indeed , the fact that many @entity76 voters still clamor for a less pro-war , less @entity77 , more @entity73 - like alternative to @entity58 is an ever - present thorn in the otherwise blooming garden of @entity58 's inevitability*****0
opinion : the myth of @entity1 with her video , @entity58 has signaled a clear desire to ground herself and her candidacy in the soil of populism*****1
but can a wealthy white woman who once sat on the board of @entity92 , has already lived in the @entity93 , collects six - figure speaking fees and does n't seem to own a pair of jeans really inhabit the portrait of a populist fighter ? this is where a good ol ' - fashioned political stunt would come in handy*****0
and make no mistake about it , i 'm recommending a political stunt*****0
let 's call a spade a spade*****0
@entity2 is a very rich person*****0
while she 's certainly not the first rich person to run for president , her wealth -- and the related perception of being out of touch with ordinary @entity64 -- is an obstacle in her candidacy*****0
the difference between the current standard presidential salary of $ 400,000 a year and the 77 cents - on - the - dollar version of that salary , or $ 308,000 , is probably a drop in the bucket in @entity58 's bank account at this point*****0
and yet the symbolic power is profound*****0
because what @entity58 would be reminding us is that across @entity5 , the aggregate salaries of all working women is 23 % less than the aggregate salaries of all men*****1
78 cents on the dollar : the facts about the gender wage gap thanks to the hacked @entity137 emails , we saw that even top female stars and executives in @entity140 are paid less than their male counterparts*****1
what more powerful message could the potential first female president send than literally signifying that nationwide inequity in her own salary ? @entity58 would n't just be saying she stands with the working women of @entity5 , she 'd be showing it*****1
is it offensive to suggest that the first female commander in chief should be paid 23 % less than her male predecessors for doing exactly the same work ? yes*****1
and that 's the point -- to use her status to highlight the offensive gender wage gap and what @entity58 , as president , would do to fix it*****1
yes , such stunts are trite and theatrical*****0
they 're also effective , especially in our increasingly short - attention - span , it - only - happened - if - you - can - tweet it , symbolism - over - substance culture*****0
politics used to be about clunky people ( mostly men ) debating complex policies*****0
now it 's about polished memes and even more polished candidates*****0
policy ( i hope ) still matters , but we 're as likely to debate a candidate 's " image " as her or his " substance*****0
" the truth is that stunts and theatrics are now part and parcel of politics , as they are in our culture in general*****0
that does n't mean they ca n't also serve a noble purpose , in highlighting important problems and inspiring solutions*****0
map : where the gender pay gap is the widest @entity58 did an arguably brilliant thing in her campaign launch , framing her video and presidential bid as not about her but the @entity5 people*****1
in fact , @entity58 did n't even appear in the video until the very end -- it was all about middle - class @entity64 , working hard , trying to get by and get ahead*****1
and then we see @entity2 , who wants to help*****0
@entity2 ca n't change who she is , the baggage attached to her by both the right and the left , rightly or wrongly*****0
but she can change what she does going forward , how she shows up and signifies herself as a voice not for the status quo and the establishment -- but for ordinary @entity64 who need change*****0
if @entity58 wins , her presidency will indeed be symbolic and historic*****0
and it will be significant if she does something to change the lives of the 158 million women in @entity5 .*****0
