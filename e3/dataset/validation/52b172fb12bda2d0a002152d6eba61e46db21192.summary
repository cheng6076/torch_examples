( @entity0 ) about 150,000 years ago -- give or take 20,000 -- a guy fell into a well*****0
last month he made science history*****0
the @entity4 became the oldest @entity5 to have his dna extracted by researchers*****0
it took them more than 20 years to get around to doing it*****0
scientists in southern @entity12 have known about him since 1993 , when spelunkers spied his skull staring blankly back at them from its nook in the @entity21 cave , deep under the town of @entity23*****1
the cave explorers told researchers at the @entity26 what they 'd found , according to their report published in march in the @entity29 and @entity30*****0
@entity4 's intact skull and jumbled pile of bones made for a great specimen , but they were wedged into a panoply of stalactites and stony globules deposited by water dripping over them for tens of thousands of years*****0
researchers decided not to rescue the bones for fear that trying to ease them out of the cave 's calcified grip would shatter them and ruin @entity4*****1
so , they left him forever a cave man*****0
@entity46 pebbles line the @entity5 's eye sockets , nose bone and an upper jaw like a hundred decorative piercings*****0
analysis of the calcite has shown the bones to be 128,000 to 187,000 years old*****0
scientists believe @entity4 wound up in the cave at least that long ago after falling into a prehistoric well , then died in the caverns at its bottom of thirst or hunger*****0
recently , researchers made an exception , and toted off a chip from his right shoulder blade to the lab. metrics taken of his skeleton confirm @entity4 was a homo neanderthalensis*****0
