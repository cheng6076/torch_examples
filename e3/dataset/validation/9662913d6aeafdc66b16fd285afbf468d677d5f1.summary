( @entity1 ) governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism -- real or perceived -- to advance executions , @entity0 alleges in its annual report on the death penalty . " the dark trend of governments using the death penalty in a futile attempt to tackle real or imaginary threats to state security and public safety was stark last year , " said @entity9 , @entity0 's secretary general in a release . " it is shameful that so many states around the world are essentially playing with people 's lives -- putting people to death for ' terrorism ' or to quell internal instability on the ill - conceived premise of deterrence . " the report , " @entity37 and executions 2014 , " cites the example of @entity30 lifting a six - year moratorium on the execution of civilians following the horrific attack on a school in @entity36 in december . @entity38 is also mentioned , as having used the death penalty as a tool in its " @entity45 " campaign against terrorism in the restive far - western province of @entity44 . the annual report catalogs the use of state - sanctioned killing as a punitive measure across the globe , and this year 's edition contains some mixed findings . on one hand , the number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost 22 % on the previous year . at least 607 people were executed around the world in 2014 , compared to 778 in 2013 . @entity0 's figures do not include statistics on executions carried out in @entity38 , where information on the practice is regarded as a state secret . @entity64 and @entity65 , too , do not release data on death penalty cases . " the long - term trend is definitely positive -- we are seeing a decrease in the number of executions ( worldwide ) , " @entity68 , @entity0 's director of global issues , told @entity1 . " a number of countries are closer to abolition , and there are some signs that some countries will be abolitionist by 2015 . ( there are ) signals of a world that is nearing abolition . " while the report notes some encouraging signs , it also highlights a marked increase in the number of people sentenced to death in 2014 . at least 2,466 people globally are confirmed to have been handed the sentence last year , an increase of 28 % compared with 2013 . the report notes that the spike in sentencing is attributable to mass - sentencing in countries including @entity97 and @entity98 , " against scores of people in some cases . " the organization found " positive developments " worldwide , with most regions seeming to show reductions in the number of executions . opinion : @entity110 spike in death sentences @entity113 , for example , saw a 28 % fall in reported cases , and executions recorded in the @entity116 and @entity117 were down 23 % compared to 2013 . " even though we 've highlighted some of the negative developments ... i think we would always highlight that there are positive developments , " @entity68 said . " across the board , with the exception of @entity124 and @entity125 there were fewer reports of executions in every region . " the resumption of the use of capital punishment in @entity64 -- the only country in @entity124 and @entity125 to execute people -- after a two year hiatus spoiled an near - universal decrease in countries using the death penalty by region . the @entity140 has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the @entity143 to conduct executions , but the number of convicts put to death here fell slightly , from 39 in 2013 to 35 in 2014 . the state of @entity150 also imposed a moratorium on executions last year . the @entity140 remains one of the worst offenders for imposing capital punishment , with only @entity156 ( 289 + ) , @entity157 ( 61 + ) , and @entity158 ( 90 + ) executing more people in 2014 . while figures are not available , @entity0 estimates that @entity38 also executes " thousands " of prisoners each year , " more than the rest of the world put together . " the report also highlights the imperfections in the judiciary processes that lead to many sentenced to death . " in the majority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed , the death penalty was imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards , " the report stated . " in 2014 @entity0 raised particular concerns in relation to court proceedings in @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity38 , @entity97 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity182 , @entity30 , @entity158 and @entity183 . " the @entity185 secretary - general , @entity184 , last year stressed the need to move toward abolition of capital punishment . " the taking of life is too irreversible for one human being to inflict it on another , " he said , in marking @entity189 against @entity37 in october . " we must continue to argue strongly that the death penalty is unjust and incompatible with fundamental human rights . " @entity0 estimates that at least 19,094 people were believed to be on death row at the end of 2014 .
