( @entity2 ) @entity1 's controversial religious freedom law has been in hot water lately . after a firestorm of backlash and protests , gov. @entity4 said on tuesday that the state will " fix " the @entity9 , or @entity9 , so it will not discriminate against gays and lesbians . @entity4 is making the right call . promoting the false dichotomy between protecting religion versus protecting equality serves no one . not all people who dislike the law hate religion , and not all people who like the law want to discriminate against the @entity23 community . if people of good will come together , liberty and equality can both be saved . the unbelievably easy way to fix @entity1 's @entity9 is to add one small amendment , one easy line codifying that discrimination against the @entity23 community is harmful , and that there is a compelling governmental interest in eliminating that harm . in general , it is a good thing for society to shape its laws in ways that allow people to live their lives consistent with their sincerely held religious obligations . as @entity42 , we value and always have valued the freedom and expression of religion . sometimes , a law seems to impose only modest burdens on the people it affects , but in practice it actually severely burdens the religious practices of a few . in those situations , if there is no compelling governmental interest in enforcing that law in that particularly burdensome way -- and if no one else is harmed -- then religion should be granted an exemption . shifting the burden to the government to prove that it really does need to apply this law in this particular way will not allow every person to become a law unto themselves ; it simply sends the message that religion is important , and unless there are specific and compelling reasons why , people should be allowed to practice as they need . these are the reasons why the federal @entity9 was passed in 1993 , and why it had bipartisan support . these are wholesome @entity42 values that everyone can get behind . the problem is that we no longer live in 1993 , 10 years before @entity79 , and 20 before @entity42 v. @entity80 . in 1993 , our sensibilities were different ; there was not yet a national conversation about the need to protect the rights and dignity of members of the lgbt community . timing matters because society changes , and now that our horizons have been broadened we can not just keep insisting that the law was never intended to discriminate and worked just fine 22 years ago , before we realized its negative potential . even if not a single lawmaker consciously intends the bill to be used as a shield for discrimination , we still have to take seriously justice @entity99 ' claim about unintended consequences . to put it simply , you have to be concerned with what the law allows a person to get away with . the concern is real . because @entity1 does not have a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation , the bill as drafted might allow people who were so inclined to discriminate , and simply assert that they could do so based on a religious belief . public perceptions matter . whether or not lawmakers think so , it certainly seems relevant to the general public that this bill was passed with important national decisions about marriage equality on the horizon and right after the ruling in @entity123 v. @entity124 that @entity1 's same - sex marriage ban was unconstitutional . writing for the @entity131 panel in 2014 , judge @entity127 's rationale in the case of @entity123 v. @entity129 provides the obvious answer for how to fix the @entity9 deficiency without changing what it is that it defends . courts have long held that a religious exemption can not be granted if it allows you to shift the harm to a third party , and -- as @entity127 explained so simply -- discrimination is harmful . rfras are not inherently evil . the message can be nondiscriminatory and religion can be protected . the principles of @entity9 can remain unchanged ; it is just the definition of harmful that evolves . a few simple words have the potential to completely change the conversation , send an important message about the value of equality , and make @entity1 into a shining beacon of cooperation : the real " crossroads of @entity42 .

( @entity2 ) @entity1 's controversial religious freedom law has been in hot water lately*****1
after a firestorm of backlash and protests , gov. @entity4 said on tuesday that the state will " fix " the @entity9 , or @entity9 , so it will not discriminate against gays and lesbians*****1
@entity4 is making the right call*****1
promoting the false dichotomy between protecting religion versus protecting equality serves no one*****0
not all people who dislike the law hate religion , and not all people who like the law want to discriminate against the @entity23 community*****0
if people of good will come together , liberty and equality can both be saved*****0
the unbelievably easy way to fix @entity1 's @entity9 is to add one small amendment , one easy line codifying that discrimination against the @entity23 community is harmful , and that there is a compelling governmental interest in eliminating that harm*****1
in general , it is a good thing for society to shape its laws in ways that allow people to live their lives consistent with their sincerely held religious obligations*****0
as @entity42 , we value and always have valued the freedom and expression of religion*****0
sometimes , a law seems to impose only modest burdens on the people it affects , but in practice it actually severely burdens the religious practices of a few*****1
in those situations , if there is no compelling governmental interest in enforcing that law in that particularly burdensome way -- and if no one else is harmed -- then religion should be granted an exemption*****0
shifting the burden to the government to prove that it really does need to apply this law in this particular way will not allow every person to become a law unto themselves ; it simply sends the message that religion is important , and unless there are specific and compelling reasons why , people should be allowed to practice as they need*****0
these are the reasons why the federal @entity9 was passed in 1993 , and why it had bipartisan support*****0
these are wholesome @entity42 values that everyone can get behind*****0
the problem is that we no longer live in 1993 , 10 years before @entity79 , and 20 before @entity42 v. @entity80*****0
in 1993 , our sensibilities were different ; there was not yet a national conversation about the need to protect the rights and dignity of members of the lgbt community*****0
timing matters because society changes , and now that our horizons have been broadened we can not just keep insisting that the law was never intended to discriminate and worked just fine 22 years ago , before we realized its negative potential*****0
even if not a single lawmaker consciously intends the bill to be used as a shield for discrimination , we still have to take seriously justice @entity99 ' claim about unintended consequences*****0
to put it simply , you have to be concerned with what the law allows a person to get away with*****0
the concern is real*****0
because @entity1 does not have a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation , the bill as drafted might allow people who were so inclined to discriminate , and simply assert that they could do so based on a religious belief*****1
public perceptions matter*****0
whether or not lawmakers think so , it certainly seems relevant to the general public that this bill was passed with important national decisions about marriage equality on the horizon and right after the ruling in @entity123 v. @entity124 that @entity1 's same - sex marriage ban was unconstitutional*****1
writing for the @entity131 panel in 2014 , judge @entity127 's rationale in the case of @entity123 v. @entity129 provides the obvious answer for how to fix the @entity9 deficiency without changing what it is that it defends*****1
courts have long held that a religious exemption can not be granted if it allows you to shift the harm to a third party , and -- as @entity127 explained so simply -- discrimination is harmful*****1
rfras are not inherently evil*****0
the message can be nondiscriminatory and religion can be protected*****0
the principles of @entity9 can remain unchanged ; it is just the definition of harmful that evolves*****0
a few simple words have the potential to completely change the conversation , send an important message about the value of equality , and make @entity1 into a shining beacon of cooperation : the real " crossroads of @entity42*****1
" doing so would go a long way toward restoring its reputation as a place of great opportunity for all to live and worship and work .*****0
