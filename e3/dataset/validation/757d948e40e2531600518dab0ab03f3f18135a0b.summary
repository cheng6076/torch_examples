unfortunately , while it was a freshly produced segment , it was hardly a new story*****0
titled " @entity28 , " the five - minute piece is urgently introduced with the promise that it will reveal " what 's really happening in the more troubled neighborhoods of this majority black city , " going on state that a key ingredient of the unrest was african - americans " targeting @entity21 - owned businesses for destruction*****1
" a similar claim was made after @entity31 's uprising in august of last year*****0
indeed , it has been a toxic feature of the coverage of many episodes of mass metropolitan violence since the late 1980s , the era during which the trope of widespread hostility between @entity21 and black communities first took root in the media consciousness*****1
yes , interethnic tensions continue to exist , though they are hardly limited to @entity43 and blacks*****0
and yes , this has resulted in troubling incidents and tragedies on both sides*****0
but while reports say that during the chaotic social breakdowns of the past year , black - owned businesses were mostly protected during bouts of violence , there 's little evidence to suggest a pattern in which @entity21 businesses have been actively targeted out of racial animus*****1
instead , it seems as if @entity21 - owned stores have experienced damage partly because they make up a portion of establishments operating in the most economically vulnerable and socially volatile of neighborhoods*****1
in other words , they were collateral damage , along with other stores in the vicinity of riots*****0
so it 's time to call this persistent meme what it is : a misleading , hyperbolic and dangerous distraction , one that shifts blame away from the real issues*****0

but things are different now*****0
decades after the height of media - inflamed tension between @entity21 and @entity105 , patterns of immigration have shifted*****1
stores once operated by recent @entity116 immigrants are now owned by strivers from @entity133 , the @entity134 and @entity135*****0
the population of @entity2 has shrunk and its economy has contracted*****0
among merchants , there 's ever - greater recognition that they and their customers are tied by a red thread , surviving or failing together*****1
for decades , black and @entity21 advocacy groups have been trying to bridge differences between the communities*****0
for example , the @entity2 - based @entity146 of @entity147 , founded in 1995 , has worked to support its entrepreneurial members in their own attempts to address longstanding issues of neglect and abuse by @entity2 's police , while also encouraging them to build deeper ties with their constituents*****1
a kagro - sponsored annual scholarship program has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in college grants to children growing up in the @entity2 neighborhoods their member retailers serve*****1
these are n't the kind of stories you 'll hear in the media*****0
it 's easier to focus on attention - grabbing anecdotes rather than the long , hard work of adjustment and accommodation going on within and around communities*****1
back in 1995 , the @entity173 profiled soon @entity174 and @entity175 , owners of @entity115 's @entity177 in the @entity180 @entity2 's @entity179 neighborhood -- the same part of the city that @entity0 called out as a locus of @entity21 - black tension*****1
