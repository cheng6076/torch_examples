( @entity0 ) @entity3 president @entity2 's recent explanation of how his administration will engage with the @entity5 is far from reassuring to the region . in his interview with @entity8 from the @entity9 on april 4 , @entity2 explained @entity3 foreign policy moves on @entity11 and @entity12 , which @entity8 described as the " @entity2 doctrine . " he stated that " we will engage , but we preserve all our capabilities . " by capabilities , the president must mean the tools , whether diplomatic , economic or military , to protect and defend @entity3 interests . the doctrine is significant because it provides greater clarity about the @entity3 policy under the rest of @entity2 's presidency . instead of the " new beginning " that the president outlined in his much discussed @entity30 speech in 2009 , @entity3 policy in the @entity5 remains mired in a contradiction between principles and action on the ground . for example , the president asserted in the interview that " the @entity3 's core interests in the region are not oil , are not territorial ... our core interests are that everybody is living in peace , that it is orderly , that our allies are not being attacked , that children are not having barrel bombs dropped on them , that massive displacements are n't taking place . " yet , at the very moment that the president was offering this assessment , @entity3 allies , such as the @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and the legitimate government in @entity59 , found themselves under serious threat and attack ; the @entity64 regime was continuing to relentlessly bomb its own citizens ; and the @entity5 was faced with the biggest refugee crisis in its history . implementing the core @entity3 interests outlined by @entity2 in the interview is clearly not working . there exist grave doubts about whether the current @entity3 administration is indeed ready to deploy the above - mentioned " capabilities . " it seems that the @entity3 will only use them when its national security is at stake . and those core interests are limited to dealing with terrorism and nuclear proliferation only and not the broader aspects mentioned by the president . the use of drone technology across the region , the military strikes being conducted against @entity87 in @entity88 and @entity64 and the framework agreement between @entity11 and six world powers on the @entity11 nuclear programs are cases in point . establishing a region " living in peace " is clearly not an instance where those capabilities will be deployed and is not part of the so - called @entity2 doctrine . in the same vein , the majority of the @entity102 world and the entire @entity104 region look at the recently announced @entity11 nuclear deal with a sense of suspicion and trepidation . having directly experienced the problematic interventionist @entity11 policies for decades , the @entity102 world is simply not ready to give @entity111 the benefit of doubt on any regional issue . but neither is it ready to trust @entity3 assurances that outside a nuclear agreement , the @entity3 will indeed put forward a concerted strategy to contain @entity11 influence throughout the region or to defend the @entity121 ( @entity121 ) states against any @entity11 threat . instead , the fear is that as long as @entity11 abides by any agreement that might come into force later this year , the @entity3 will negate , downplay , or simply ignore those @entity11 actions that the @entity102 world considers as direct threats . here , actions speak louder than words and unfortunately one sees only the latter coming from @entity131 . at a time when the region is faced with unprecedented turmoil and transition , the president even shifted the blame and directed his criticism toward the @entity102 world . when he referred to " our @entity102 @entity141 allies " the president gave an exaggerated picture by saying " populations that , in some cases , are alienated , youth that are underemployed , an ideology that is destructive and nihilistic , and in some cases , just a belief that there are no legitimate political outlets for grievances . " what @entity2 failed to do is to highlight that this statement is in fact also applicable to @entity11 . in his interview , he never questioned @entity11 's appalling record on human rights , treatment of the political opposition , and minorities ' rights , among other disturbing issues . moreover the reference to @entity165 being one of the " @entity102 allies " ignores the fact that there are @entity169 living in the @entity102 @entity104 and adds to the existing destructive sectarian tensions as well as the sensitivity of the @entity172 . equally , the assertion that " the biggest threats that they ( the @entity141 states ) face may not be coming from @entity11 invading . it 's going to be from dissatisfaction inside their own countries ... " is another example of the detachment from reality . based on a @entity186 study , when there are 48 militia groups supported by @entity11 operating in @entity88 and tearing apart the very social fabric of that country , it is simply naive to suggest there is no @entity11 threat . the bottom line here is that @entity3 and @entity102 national security interests are no longer on the same page . ever since the @entity3 - led invasion of @entity88 in 2003 , those interests have increasingly diverged to the point that the @entity102 world is tired of false promises . the ongoing operation of ten mostly @entity141 coalition countries to protect the legitimate government of @entity59 is simply the latest move that underlines the determination of @entity141 countries to take matters in their own hands . the @entity121 states may accept the invitation by the @entity3 president to come to @entity213 , his @entity215 country retreat , and have an honest discussion with him about the situation in the region . but they question the value of being invited for purposes of being reassured when they are already being informed beforehand of what is wrong with them . the truth of the matter is that " the region is ( not ) working " and that misguided @entity3 leadership and policies are among the reasons for the enduring tragedy in this region . unfortunately , the " @entity2 doctrine " does little to change this and may in fact make matters worse .

( @entity0 ) @entity3 president @entity2 's recent explanation of how his administration will engage with the @entity5 is far from reassuring to the region*****1
in his interview with @entity8 from the @entity9 on april 4 , @entity2 explained @entity3 foreign policy moves on @entity11 and @entity12 , which @entity8 described as the " @entity2 doctrine*****1
" he stated that " we will engage , but we preserve all our capabilities*****0
" by capabilities , the president must mean the tools , whether diplomatic , economic or military , to protect and defend @entity3 interests*****0
the doctrine is significant because it provides greater clarity about the @entity3 policy under the rest of @entity2 's presidency*****1
instead of the " new beginning " that the president outlined in his much discussed @entity30 speech in 2009 , @entity3 policy in the @entity5 remains mired in a contradiction between principles and action on the ground*****1
for example , the president asserted in the interview that " the @entity3 's core interests in the region are not oil , are not territorial ... our core interests are that everybody is living in peace , that it is orderly , that our allies are not being attacked , that children are not having barrel bombs dropped on them , that massive displacements are n't taking place*****0
" yet , at the very moment that the president was offering this assessment , @entity3 allies , such as the @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and the legitimate government in @entity59 , found themselves under serious threat and attack ; the @entity64 regime was continuing to relentlessly bomb its own citizens ; and the @entity5 was faced with the biggest refugee crisis in its history*****1
implementing the core @entity3 interests outlined by @entity2 in the interview is clearly not working*****1
there exist grave doubts about whether the current @entity3 administration is indeed ready to deploy the above - mentioned " capabilities*****0
" it seems that the @entity3 will only use them when its national security is at stake*****0
and those core interests are limited to dealing with terrorism and nuclear proliferation only and not the broader aspects mentioned by the president*****0
the use of drone technology across the region , the military strikes being conducted against @entity87 in @entity88 and @entity64 and the framework agreement between @entity11 and six world powers on the @entity11 nuclear programs are cases in point*****0
establishing a region " living in peace " is clearly not an instance where those capabilities will be deployed and is not part of the so - called @entity2 doctrine*****0
in the same vein , the majority of the @entity102 world and the entire @entity104 region look at the recently announced @entity11 nuclear deal with a sense of suspicion and trepidation*****1
having directly experienced the problematic interventionist @entity11 policies for decades , the @entity102 world is simply not ready to give @entity111 the benefit of doubt on any regional issue*****1
but neither is it ready to trust @entity3 assurances that outside a nuclear agreement , the @entity3 will indeed put forward a concerted strategy to contain @entity11 influence throughout the region or to defend the @entity121 ( @entity121 ) states against any @entity11 threat*****1
instead , the fear is that as long as @entity11 abides by any agreement that might come into force later this year , the @entity3 will negate , downplay , or simply ignore those @entity11 actions that the @entity102 world considers as direct threats*****1
here , actions speak louder than words and unfortunately one sees only the latter coming from @entity131*****0
at a time when the region is faced with unprecedented turmoil and transition , the president even shifted the blame and directed his criticism toward the @entity102 world*****0
when he referred to " our @entity102 @entity141 allies " the president gave an exaggerated picture by saying " populations that , in some cases , are alienated , youth that are underemployed , an ideology that is destructive and nihilistic , and in some cases , just a belief that there are no legitimate political outlets for grievances*****0
" what @entity2 failed to do is to highlight that this statement is in fact also applicable to @entity11*****1
in his interview , he never questioned @entity11 's appalling record on human rights , treatment of the political opposition , and minorities ' rights , among other disturbing issues*****0
moreover the reference to @entity165 being one of the " @entity102 allies " ignores the fact that there are @entity169 living in the @entity102 @entity104 and adds to the existing destructive sectarian tensions as well as the sensitivity of the @entity172*****0
equally , the assertion that " the biggest threats that they ( the @entity141 states ) face may not be coming from @entity11 invading*****0

based on a @entity186 study , when there are 48 militia groups supported by @entity11 operating in @entity88 and tearing apart the very social fabric of that country , it is simply naive to suggest there is no @entity11 threat*****0
the bottom line here is that @entity3 and @entity102 national security interests are no longer on the same page*****0
ever since the @entity3 - led invasion of @entity88 in 2003 , those interests have increasingly diverged to the point that the @entity102 world is tired of false promises*****0
the ongoing operation of ten mostly @entity141 coalition countries to protect the legitimate government of @entity59 is simply the latest move that underlines the determination of @entity141 countries to take matters in their own hands*****0
the @entity121 states may accept the invitation by the @entity3 president to come to @entity213 , his @entity215 country retreat , and have an honest discussion with him about the situation in the region*****0
but they question the value of being invited for purposes of being reassured when they are already being informed beforehand of what is wrong with them*****0
the truth of the matter is that " the region is ( not ) working " and that misguided @entity3 leadership and policies are among the reasons for the enduring tragedy in this region*****1
unfortunately , the " @entity2 doctrine " does little to change this and may in fact make matters worse .*****0
