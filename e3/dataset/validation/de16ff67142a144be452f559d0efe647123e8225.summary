@entity16 ' recent announcement that it will " ban the box " -- i.e. , remove from its job applications the check - box that asks about convictions -- is a big step forward in the movement to break down barriers to employment for job - seekers with records*****1
" @entity28 " does n't prohibit background checks , it only postpones them until later in the hiring process*****0
it 's one item on a menu of fair - chance hiring reforms intended to ensure that job applicants are evaluated on their skills and qualifications first , rather than judged solely on past mistakes*****0
these policies help reduce recidivism by making employment accessible to job - seekers who need a second chance , and they help break down the stigma of an arrest or conviction record*****0
two generations of the war on drugs , zero tolerance , and aggressive policing have left 70 million adults with arrest or conviction records that undermine their ability to be considered for jobs , even as the job market has grown steadily*****1
millions of people are being left behind , and it 's taking a toll on our economy : the reduced economic output of people with records cost our economy $ 57 - $ 65 billion in 2008 alone*****0
these criminal justice policies disproportionately impact african - americans , who are incarcerated at a rate six times that of whites*****0
the @entity73 's recent investigation of the @entity74 , for example , shows the extent to which racism is perpetuated through police departments and the court system*****0
that systemic racial disparity is then repeated throughout the economy , and the community is put at a severe disadvantage in the job market long after individuals have served their time*****0
that 's one reason the @entity88 unemployment rate is persistently twice that of whites*****0
in a job market where employers that did n't previously do background checks now make them a routine part of hiring , qualified job - seekers are being screened out of the applicant pools for more and more jobs*****0
nearly one in three adults in @entity101 has an arrest or conviction history that will show up on a routine background check*****0
companies like @entity16 , @entity2 , @entity3 , and @entity106 recognize that this is a huge source of untapped talent , and that 's why they 've already banned the box on their job applications*****1
these policies are also gaining traction with politicians across the political spectrum*****0
@entity118 gov. @entity117 , @entity120 gov. @entity119 , and @entity122 gov. @entity121 recently signed executive orders removing the conviction question from initial applications for state employment*****1
so far , 16 states and more than 100 cities and counties have adopted fair - chance hiring policies*****0
six of those states and the @entity133 , plus 25 cities and counties , have applied their policies to government contractors or private employers as well*****0
the @entity140 administration took an important step toward fairer and smarter federal hiring practices last year when it issued an executive order prohibiting contractors from discriminating against @entity146 individuals*****0
banning the box and other common - sense hiring reforms would build on that progress and on the successful work of governors and the corporate sector*****0
the administration should ensure that the federal government does not continue to erect unfair and unnecessary barriers to employment of people with records*****0
already , more than 200 organizations and prominent individuals have publicly urged the @entity140 administration to take these practical steps*****0
if @entity16 -- a major federal contractor -- can ban the box , there 's no reason why other federal contractors can not*****0
now it 's time for president @entity140 to lead the way and embrace fair - chance hiring of people with records .*****0
