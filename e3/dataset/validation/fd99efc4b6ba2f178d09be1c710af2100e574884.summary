( @entity7 ) just as mimeograph machines and photocopiers were in their day , online activity -- blogs , @entity3 channels , even social media platforms like @entity5 and @entity6 -- have fully emerged as the alternative to traditional mainstream media*****1
it is not just the low cost of posting online that attracts dissidence , though that in itself is liberating*****0
it is the lack of access to traditional print and broadcast media in authoritarian countries that is really the driving force leading disaffected voices to post online*****0
it is not unique to @entity25 , but it might seem more pronounced if you live there*****0
going online has become the path of least resistance if you want to make yourself heard*****1
but it still brings resistance , some of it legal , some of it deadly*****0
let 's look at the legal angle first*****0
@entity39 , the teenage video blogger who was arrested and held pending bail sunday in @entity41 , drew international attention for his @entity44 harangue*****0
but jailing critics is not usually the government 's first choice in @entity41*****0
it is part of @entity50 's legacy that the government 's use of the courts to bring libel and defamation cases , usually carrying heavy financial penalties , is the preferred method of silencing discomfiting online voices*****0
his father has reportedly apologized for his son 's behavior , but the younger @entity39 could face up to three years in jail*****0
@entity39 is not unique*****0
another dissident blogger in @entity41 , @entity64 , continues to suffer financial and legal pressure , including the loss of his job , because of a blog post that allegedly accused the city - state 's prime minister , @entity71 , of corruption*****0
@entity64 's concern is with the lack of transparency in the management of the @entity77 , the government 's compulsory pension program*****0
@entity39 and @entity64 are two of many*****0
the @entity81 ' file on @entity41 going back to 2000 has a long string of similar cases , some against politicians , others against citizens simply frustrated with their government*****0
but it is not just @entity41 where internet activity comes under fire : on monday in @entity93 , with much less of the international attention heaped on @entity39 , five editors and executives from @entity96 were arrested over the site 's march 25 report claiming that a senior council of royal rulers and state governors , known as the @entity102 , had rejected a proposal to amend federal law to allow for the introduction of hudud , or punishments meted out under @entity109 law*****1
in deeply @entity112 @entity93 , questions of @entity109 faith are a third - rail issue , as is revealing government decisions before they are announced*****0
by far the biggest jailer of journalists in the world is @entity118 , where a majority of the 44 people behind bars at the end of 2014 were bloggers , most of them @entity124 or @entity127 activists who straddle the line between journalism and activism*****1
but in second place in @entity25 is @entity132 , where @entity81 's most recent prison census showed @entity132 holding 16 reporters behind bars as of december 1*****0
add one more in late december , @entity138 , a prominent blogger who was arrested for " law - violating " after police searched his home in southern @entity142 on december 27 , and two more in january , @entity135 and @entity136 , arrested on anti-state charges of " abusing democratic freedoms " and you can see the pattern*****0
because the print and broadcast media are so totally government controlled , mainstream journalists seldom go to jail any more in @entity132*****0
only two investigative print reporters remain behind bars in @entity132 , their cases dating back to 2012 and 2013*****0
both were accused of accepting bribes for dialing back critical news coverage*****0
the list could go on , but the reality is that , as @entity81 wrote in 2013 , across @entity25 " governments have curtailed @entity161 freedoms through increasingly restrictive practices , including prohibitive laws , heightened surveillance and censorship , and threats of imprisonment on various national security - related offenses*****0
" that is still the policy path being followed by most countries in @entity25 , and it does not look like it will be changing any time soon*****0
jailing journalists is one thing , but watching them being killed and doing little or nothing about it is another*****1
since 1992 , 11 % of journalists killed have died for their work online*****1
because our 1992 start date really precedes the full advent of the @entity161 , that proportion can be expected to grow*****0
while most bloggers have not been the targets of murderers , @entity182 has recently become the exception*****0
on monday , @entity187 was the second blogger to be hacked to death in public in @entity182 in the past five weeks*****0
@entity190 and his wife , @entity191 , were attacked by assailants wielding sharp weapons while the couple was visiting @entity195*****0
@entity190 , a @entity196 citizen of @entity182 origin , was killed and his wife was critically injured*****0
both @entity199 and @entity190 had written critically on @entity109 matters*****0
the blogger death toll gets higher in @entity182 if you go back a year or two , and religious beliefs are always involved , and the killings almost always carried out with near perfect impunity*****0
in january 2013 , blogger @entity210 , who wrote critical commentary on religion , @entity207 groups , free speech , and human rights , barely survived after he was stabbed by @entity109*****0
in february 2013 , blogger @entity213 , who had written about @entity109 fundamentalism and @entity207 groups , was hacked to death by members of an @entity207 militant group , according to police investigations*****0
later in 2013 , @entity207 groups called for the execution of bloggers they said had committed blasphemy*****0
while arrests were made after those murders , there have been no convictions*****0
the bottom line : online journalists , operating outside the restraints of mainstream media , have become the most vulnerable targets for governments and independent actors*****1
where there is the restrictive rule of law , journalists are vulnerable to the anger of officialdom*****1
where the rule of law is weak , they are vulnerable to the attacks of killers who seldom , if ever , answer to the rule of law .*****1
