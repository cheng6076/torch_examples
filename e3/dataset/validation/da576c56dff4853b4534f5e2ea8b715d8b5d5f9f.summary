@entity1 ( @entity2 ) in 2011 , @entity0 took @entity4 hostage . then , about a year later , his family paid money to his captors , said a @entity10 source who was in regular contact with the kidnappers . it did not lead to the @entity16 aid worker 's release , and he was inadvertently killed in an anti-terror strike in january , the @entity13 announced thursday . after the transfer of funds in 2012 , the captors , who never referred to themselves as " @entity0 , " but instead as " @entity20 , " began demanding prisoners be released in exchange for @entity4 , most prominently dr. @entity25 of @entity10 , the source said . she has been described as the " poster girl " for @entity28 jihad and is serving an 86 - year sentence in the @entity16 . the militants also wanted the release of local militants who hailed from the @entity10 province of @entity35 , along the @entity20 border , the source said . the men on the other end of the phone spoke @entity40 with an accent typical for the border region . and they were professional in their dealings , said the source , who noticed a marked change after the money was paid . the people who had originally talked to the source about @entity4 vanished and were replaced by new voices on the phone . the militants also connected themselves with other terror events . after @entity56 beheaded @entity16 @entity55 , @entity4 's @entity20 captors told the source that " the @entity63 " were asking for the @entity16 and that they were preparing an " orange suit " for him -- a reference to the suits that victims have worn when @entity56 militants murdered them . when the @entity64 released @entity66 sgt. @entity65 , a militant on the phone bragged to the source that he had been one of @entity70 's kidnappers . they had said , at one point , that if they did kill @entity4 , they 'd announce it in a big way , because he was too big a catch not to publicly celebrate . the captors had called the source daily since sometime in 2012 , and the last time the source spoke with them , in early april , they said that @entity4 was still alive . in spite of a request for proof of life , the militants did n't give one . after that , the calls stopped . the source never had a number for the militants ; they had always been the ones who called . the source declined to comment on the amount of money transferred to the captors , leaving the disclosure to @entity4 's family . could @entity4 have been saved ? @entity4 's family in @entity101 was initially reluctant to take their case to @entity104 . @entity4 's wife , @entity106 , and his two daughters worried that drawing attention to their loved one 's plight -- especially media attention -- would make @entity4 , a government contractor working with @entity113 in @entity10 , a more valuable hostage to his @entity0 captors . but the family switched course and went to their representatives in @entity104 in late 2013 after a video of @entity4 -- frail and apparently in declining health -- surfaced in which he said he felt " totally abandoned and forgotten " by his country . will the drone debate return ? more than a year later , that reluctance evolved into a close bond between the @entity127 and the @entity101 delegation of lawmakers and staff who pressed @entity4 's case with the @entity133 administration as well as @entity10 . the congressional offices helped the family navigate the maze of government agencies working to free their loved one , according to one of those lawmakers and a @entity142 aide . " we do n't get choked up too often at work , " @entity143 said as she held back tears . " but this is really hard . " @entity147 is a foreign policy adviser to sen. @entity149 , @entity101 , who worked closely on the case . after the @entity13 announced that @entity4 had been accidentally killed in a january @entity16 drone strike , the aide 's first call was to @entity4 's daughters . " myself and my colleague worked really closely with them , talked to them all the time ... they 're just such good people , " @entity143 said of the family . " there 's a personal connection there . " @entity149 and his staff had tracked the @entity4 case since news of his abduction surfaced in august 2011 , but when the family reached out to get help pressing their case , @entity149 's staff joined forces with rep. @entity174 , the @entity127 ' congressman , and began setting up meetings for the family . @entity149 's staff set up meetings for the senator and @entity4 's family with everyone from the @entity16 special representative to @entity20 and @entity10 to the @entity10 ambassador in @entity1 . @entity149 and sen. @entity183 , @entity101 , wrote to president @entity133 , calling on the @entity16 to beef up efforts to secure @entity4 's release and dedicate more resources to the cause . and the staff and lawmakers helped the @entity190 weave through the network of agencies -- from the @entity193 to the @entity194 and the @entity13 -- working to bring @entity4 home . " we focused on making sure that the capabilities of the government was well coordinated , " @entity196 told @entity2 on thursday . " the government is a bureaucracy , and you have to make sure that it 's working . " but for the @entity127 and the families of other @entity16 hostages held by terror groups abroad , the government has n't always worked well enough -- a frustration that was palpable to the staffers on @entity209 who worked to help them . @entity0 hostage @entity4 killed " unfortunately , the assistance we received from other elements of the @entity217 was inconsistent and disappointing over the course of three and a half years , " @entity212 said in a statement thursday . " we hope that my husband 's death and the others who have faced similar tragedies in recent months will finally prompt the @entity16 government to take its responsibilities seriously and establish a coordinated and consistent approach to supporting hostages and their families . " it 's a criticism that has resurfaced as the families of @entity16 hostages were killed abroad spoke up and voiced their frustrations with what they characterized as insufficient @entity16 government efforts to bring their loved ones home . @entity196 was " saddened , disappointed and outraged that our government was not able to bring @entity4 home , " he said in a statement thursday . and in an interview with @entity2 later in the day , he strayed away from blaming the @entity133 administration or people in various @entity16 agencies , instead pointing the finger at a disjointed system . the @entity4 family 's frustration with that system boiled over last summer when @entity70 , the @entity66 sergeant , was released by a @entity64 - affiliated group in exchange for five @entity250 prisoners . the @entity16 policy of not negotiating with terrorists appeared to have an exception . " it 's one of those things where it 's both there 's some hope , but at the same time it caused them some great frustration , " @entity196 recalled , saying the family asked : " why not @entity4 ? " but as the @entity194 called the @entity70 exchange a " unique situation , " the @entity127 ' hopes were dashed . " that 's when they asked us to really step up our efforts , " @entity143 said . " that 's when they decided to really go public . " @entity196 introduced a resolution calling on the @entity133 administration to use all tools necessary to bring @entity4 home and make his return -- and that of other @entity16 hostages abroad -- a top priority . @entity183 , @entity149 and sens. @entity279 and @entity280 of @entity281 pushed a similar resolution in the @entity142 . and the @entity127 took to the airwaves , with @entity284 appearing on @entity2 's " @entity285 " to make a public appeal for her father 's release -- and for the @entity16 government to do more to secure his freedom . " my father is just as deserving of freedom as sgt. @entity70 , as are all of the @entity16 who are being held abroad , " she said on @entity2 last june . " you can not distinguish between these hostages . ... they ca n't just pick and choose , decide that it works to get one person out and then leave everybody else there . " @entity13 press secretary @entity301 on thursday said that " significant resources " were dedicated to try to free @entity4 and that " as painful as it is , " the @entity16 policy of not negotiating with terrorists would remain in place , arguing that removing that policy could promote kidnappings abroad and put more @entity16 at risk . and @entity194 acting spokeswoman @entity309 said many officials at the department were in touch with the @entity127 throughout the process . while the @entity16 policy of not negotiating with terrorists would remain in place , the @entity194 is reviewing how it works to secure the release of @entity16 hostages held by terrorists abroad , she said . the @entity13 announced the review last fall , which @entity133 ordered last summer after terrorists killed or kidnapped @entity16 abroad . speaking at the @entity321 on friday , @entity133 reiterated that the @entity13 will review what happened .

" @entity133 made to sure to praise the intelligence community overall , noting that much of their accomplishments remain classified , while only their failures become public . " the world does n't always see your successes -- the threats you prevent , or the terrorist attacks you thwart , or the lives that you save , " @entity133 said . " it can be frustrating sometimes , but that 's part of the function of our democracy . but i know what you do . " but @entity196 , the @entity127 ' congressman , is revving up to push for more reforms that will make government agencies more effective at finding and freeing @entity16 hostages held abroad . @entity196 on thursday called on the government to streamline the efforts of various agencies and countries in the region that help the @entity16 find @entity16 hostages -- an effort he 's been pushing in recent months . the tragedy of @entity4 's death could be just the momentum needed to spur those reforms .
