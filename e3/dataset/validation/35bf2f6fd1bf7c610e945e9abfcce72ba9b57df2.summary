@entity2 ( @entity3 ) a @entity1 detective apologized friday for an angry exchange with an uber driver that was caught on video and landed him on modified assignment . " i apologize . i sincerely apologize , " @entity9 told @entity11 's @entity10 . @entity9 , an @entity1 detective assigned to the @entity13 's @entity12 with top - secret security clearance , faces suspension , reassignment or loss of his clearance after the video of the altercation went viral . " i was just angry , at that moment , for that exchange . " @entity9 said . " if the conversation initially went differently , we probably would have shook hands at the end of that encounter . " the altercation began monday when the @entity29 driver gestured to a detective in an unmarked car to use his blinker after he was allegedly attempting to park without using it , according to @entity34 , a passenger in the car who uploaded the video to @entity37 . the video picks up seconds after the detective began yelling at the driver and mocking his accent , and also shows the unmarked car with lights flashing pulled over behind the @entity29 car . in the video , the detective tells the driver he has committed " three traffic and law violations " and then becomes irate and uses expletives toward the comparably calm driver . a visibly upset police commissioner @entity50 on wednesday said the detective was placed on modified assignment pending an investigation . " no good cop can watch that without a wince , " he told reporters . " as all good cops know ... the officer made their jobs a little bit harder . that kind of anger like that is unacceptable in any encounter ; discourtesy like that and language like that is unacceptable . that officer 's behavior reflected poorly on everyone who wears our uniform . " @entity9 also apologized to the police commissioner , saying " he 's doing a lot of good work to strengthen community relations in the city and i set that back . i would work , personally work to fix that . " " you ca n't judge three minutes of a tape involving me and me alone as indication that that 's the kind of practice of the @entity1 , " he added . @entity50 , who said the detective was on duty at the time , issued an apology to the driver and passengers . mayor @entity94 told reporters at an unrelated news conference that he had not seen the video . " there 's just no place for any public servant to use discriminatory or negative language , " he said . " obviously , our police play a particularly sensitive role and need to show respect for all people . " in a statement , @entity107 , president of the @entity108 , called the officer " a person of good character and an excellent detective " who " should not be judged by one isolated incident . " " i am not trying to minimize the significance of what occurred , " @entity107 said . " i am simply pointing out that cops are just like everyone else . they have families , friends and other things going on in their lives , too , that may affect their behavior at times . there is no disputing that we are held to a higher standard , that is why this incident is so newsworthy . " in the video , after the detective steps back to his car , the @entity29 driver , who moved to @entity135 less than two years ago , turns to the passenger and thanks him for recording the video . " that 's crazy . that 's really inappropriate , " the passenger tells the driver . " listen , it 's not your fault . he should n't be slamming your car door , throwing things around . he does n't have a right to open your door . " when the detective comes back , he is irate and does n't allow the driver to speak . " i do n't care what you have to say , people are allowed to park their cars on the side of the street without your interference , " the detective tells the driver . " i do n't know where you 're coming from , where you think it 's appropriate in doing that . that 's the way it works . " " i 've got news for you , " the detective says , " the only reason you 're not in handcuffs and going to jail and getting summons in the precinct is because i have things to do . that 's the only reason that 's not happening . because this is n't important enough for me . you 're not important enough . do n't ever do that again . " the @entity1 said the @entity181 is investigating the incident . " the behavior in the video is wrong and unacceptable and we appreciate the @entity1 investigating the incident . we are in touch with our driver - partner who was subjected to this terrible experience and will continue to provide any support he needs , " @entity29 said tuesday . @entity34 met wednesday with an investigator from the @entity191 , according to board spokeswoman @entity192 . the investigator is attempting to interview the driver as well as the police officer . the findings will be presented to the board , which will make an official determination on whether misconduct was committed , @entity192 said . the board will either refer the decision to the @entity1 with a disciplinary recommendation , or decide to bring up the officer on administrative charges , with the decision presented to the police commissioner . @entity3 's @entity206 contributed to this report .
