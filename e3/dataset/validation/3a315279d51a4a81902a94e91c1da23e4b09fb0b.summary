( @entity0 ) whether quaffing artisanal cocktails at hipster bars or knocking back no - name beers on the couch , more @entity5 are drinking heavily -- and engaging in episodes of binge - drinking , concludes a major study of alcohol use*****1
heavy drinking among @entity5 rose 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012 , largely due to rising rates among women , according to the study by the @entity14 at the @entity15 , published thursday in the @entity16*****1
the @entity17 defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day during the past month for women and two drinks per day for men*****1
binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month*****1
the increases are driven largely by women 's drinking habits as social norms change , researchers found*****1
in @entity37 , @entity38 , for example , women 's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36 percent between 2002 and 2012 , compared with 23 percent among men*****1
nationwide over the course of the decade , the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men*****1
opinion : why are more women drinking ? " it seems like women are trying to catch up to the men in binge drinking , " said @entity49 , a lead author of the study*****1
" it 's really , really scary*****0
" the study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level*****0
in 2012 , 8 percent of @entity5 were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers*****1
despite the increases in heavy drinking , the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time , researchers found*****1
@entity67 , @entity68 , reported the lowest rate of binge drinking in 2012 , at 6 percent , while @entity71 , @entity72 , had the highest rate , at 36 percent*****1
@entity74 , @entity75 , had the fewest heavy drinkers ( 2 percent of residents ) and @entity78 , @entity79 , recorded the most ( 22 percent )*****0
related : 1 in 5 high school girls binge drink about 88,600 @entity5 deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010 , the researchers note , and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $ 220 billion per year*****1
the increase in binge drinking does n't surprise @entity89 , clinical director of the @entity90 in @entity91 , @entity38 , where 15 of her 24 treatment beds are filled with clients primarily addicted to alcohol*****1
she said she 's seen more people seeking treatment for alcoholism in the past four years*****0
still , she noted , " there are a lot of people still out there needing treatment , but they wo n't come in unless they have a consequence like losing a job or [ getting ] a @entity104*****0

as a result of changed social norms , it 's now more acceptable for women to drink the way men traditionally have , said @entity119 , scientific director at the @entity120 at the @entity122 , @entity38 - based @entity121*****1
young people are more likely to binge drink , and affluent people have the money to drink more*****0
so the influx of wealthy professionals in cities like @entity131 , @entity91 and @entity122 -- many in hard - working , hard - partying tech jobs -- may have helped spur significant spikes in drinking rates in the @entity136 and similar communities , experts said*****0
taxes on alcohol have not risen along with the @entity141 , so wine , beer and liquor have gotten cheaper over time in real dollars , he said*****0
alcohol advertising , particularly for hard liquor , has increased in recent years*****0
a @entity149 study found that companies spent about $ 3.45 billion to advertise alcoholic beverages in 2011*****0
alcohol control policies , such as limits on when and where alcohol can be sold and how long bars can stay open , have weakened in past decades , @entity119 said*****0
that may partly explain rising consumption nationwide , particularly in some states where " blue laws " once prohibited alcohol sales on sundays or in supermarkets*****0
to conduct the study , researchers analyzed data on about 3.7 million @entity5 aged 21 and older from the @entity166 , an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors conducted by the @entity17*****0
