( @entity3 ) the mass killings of @entity1 in the @entity2 , which began 100 years ago friday , is said by some scholars and others to have been the first genocide of the 20th century , even though the word " genocide " did not exist at the time . the issue of whether to call the killings a genocide is emotional , both for @entity1 , who are descended from those killed , and for @entity13 , the heirs to the @entity2 . for both groups , the question touches as much on national identity as on historical facts . some @entity1 feel their nationhood can not be fully recognized unless the truth of what happened to their forebears is acknowledged . some @entity13 still view the @entity1 as having been a threat to the @entity2 in a time of war , and say many people of various ethnicities -- including @entity13 -- were killed in the chaos of war . in addition , some @entity13 leaders fear that acknowledgment of a genocide could lead to demands for huge reparations . so , what do we know about happened in those fateful days ? here are some answers : the @entity2 , having recently entered @entity39 on the side of @entity41 and the @entity42 , were worried that @entity1 living in the @entity2 would offer wartime assistance to @entity44 . @entity44 had long coveted control of @entity46 ( now @entity47 ) , which controlled access to the @entity49 -- and therefore access to @entity44 's only year - round seaports . many historians agree that the number was about 2 million . however , victims of the mass killings also included some of the 1.8 million @entity1 living in the @entity56 under @entity44 rule , some of whom were massacred by @entity2 forces in 1918 as they marched through @entity61 and @entity62 . by 1914 , @entity2 authorities were already portraying @entity1 as a threat to the empire 's security . then , on the night of april 23 - 24 , 1915 , the authorities in @entity46 , the empire 's capital , rounded up about 250 @entity70 intellectuals and community leaders . many of them ended up deported or assassinated . april 24 , known as @entity74 , is commemorated as @entity75 by @entity1 around the world . friday is the 100th anniversary of that day . this is a major point of contention . estimates range from 300,000 to 2 million deaths between 1914 and 1923 , with not all of the victims in the @entity2 . but most estimates -- including one of 800,000 between 1915 and 1918 , made by @entity2 authorities themselves -- fall between 600,000 and 1.5 million . whether due to killings or forced deportation , the number of @entity1 living in @entity13 fell from 2 million in 1914 to under 400,000 by 1922 . almost any way one can imagine . while the death toll is in dispute , photographs from the era document some mass killings . some show @entity2 soldiers posing with severed heads , others with them standing amid skulls in the dirt . the victims are reported to have died in mass burnings and by drowning , torture , gas , poison , disease and starvation . children were reported to have been loaded into boats , taken out to sea and thrown overboard . rape , too , was frequently reported . in addition , according to the website armenian - genocide.org , " the great bulk of the @entity70 population was forcibly removed from @entity61 and @entity111 to @entity112 , where the vast majority was sent into the desert to die of thirst and hunger .

( @entity3 ) the mass killings of @entity1 in the @entity2 , which began 100 years ago friday , is said by some scholars and others to have been the first genocide of the 20th century , even though the word " genocide " did not exist at the time*****1
the issue of whether to call the killings a genocide is emotional , both for @entity1 , who are descended from those killed , and for @entity13 , the heirs to the @entity2*****1
for both groups , the question touches as much on national identity as on historical facts*****0
some @entity1 feel their nationhood can not be fully recognized unless the truth of what happened to their forebears is acknowledged*****0
some @entity13 still view the @entity1 as having been a threat to the @entity2 in a time of war , and say many people of various ethnicities -- including @entity13 -- were killed in the chaos of war*****0
in addition , some @entity13 leaders fear that acknowledgment of a genocide could lead to demands for huge reparations*****1
so , what do we know about happened in those fateful days ? here are some answers : the @entity2 , having recently entered @entity39 on the side of @entity41 and the @entity42 , were worried that @entity1 living in the @entity2 would offer wartime assistance to @entity44*****0
@entity44 had long coveted control of @entity46 ( now @entity47 ) , which controlled access to the @entity49 -- and therefore access to @entity44 's only year - round seaports*****0
many historians agree that the number was about 2 million*****0
however , victims of the mass killings also included some of the 1.8 million @entity1 living in the @entity56 under @entity44 rule , some of whom were massacred by @entity2 forces in 1918 as they marched through @entity61 and @entity62*****1
by 1914 , @entity2 authorities were already portraying @entity1 as a threat to the empire 's security*****0
then , on the night of april 23 - 24 , 1915 , the authorities in @entity46 , the empire 's capital , rounded up about 250 @entity70 intellectuals and community leaders*****0
many of them ended up deported or assassinated*****0
april 24 , known as @entity74 , is commemorated as @entity75 by @entity1 around the world*****0
friday is the 100th anniversary of that day*****1
this is a major point of contention*****0
estimates range from 300,000 to 2 million deaths between 1914 and 1923 , with not all of the victims in the @entity2*****1
but most estimates -- including one of 800,000 between 1915 and 1918 , made by @entity2 authorities themselves -- fall between 600,000 and 1.5 million*****1
whether due to killings or forced deportation , the number of @entity1 living in @entity13 fell from 2 million in 1914 to under 400,000 by 1922*****1
almost any way one can imagine*****0
while the death toll is in dispute , photographs from the era document some mass killings*****1
some show @entity2 soldiers posing with severed heads , others with them standing amid skulls in the dirt*****0
the victims are reported to have died in mass burnings and by drowning , torture , gas , poison , disease and starvation*****0
children were reported to have been loaded into boats , taken out to sea and thrown overboard*****0
rape , too , was frequently reported*****0
in addition , according to the website armenian - genocide.org , " the great bulk of the @entity70 population was forcibly removed from @entity61 and @entity111 to @entity112 , where the vast majority was sent into the desert to die of thirst and hunger*****0
" @entity119 was not even a word at the time , much less a legally defined crime*****0
the word " genocide " was invented in 1944 by a @entity125 lawyer named @entity126 to describe the @entity128 ' systematic attempt to eradicate @entity129 from @entity130*****1
he formed the word by combining the @entity134 word for race with the @entity137 word for killing*****0
genocide became a crime in 1948 , when the @entity141 approved the convention on the @entity143*****0
the definition included acts meant " to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group*****0
" @entity61 , the @entity149 , the @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity44 and @entity152*****0
@entity41 is expected to join that group on friday , the 100th anniversary of the start of the killings*****1
@entity13 , the @entity157 , the @entity158 , the @entity159 and the @entity141*****0
a @entity141 subcommittee called the killings genocide in 1985 , but current @entity141 @entity162 ban ki - moon declines to use the word*****1
also , a year ago , on the eve of the 99th anniversary of @entity74 , then - @entity13 prime minister ( now - president ) @entity164 offered condolences for the mass killings , which he said had " inhumane consequences*****1
" while @entity13 vehemently continues to reject the word " genocide , " his remarks went further than those of any previous @entity13 leader in acknowledging the suffering of @entity1 .*****1
