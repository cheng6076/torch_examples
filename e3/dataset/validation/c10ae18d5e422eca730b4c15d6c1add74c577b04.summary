( @entity1 ) @entity0 finally answered the question we 've all been asking for years : will she run for president in 2016 ? with official news of her candidacy just hours old , one thing is already crystal clear : for the next year and a half , @entity10 will be the barometer by which we assess gender equality in the @entity15 . win or lose , this creates a burden for her that no male candidate will ever have to shoulder . just consider the two potential outcomes . a win would mean a woman in the @entity23 , which is a vital step in the march toward women 's full political inclusion . but it 's possible that the march will end right there . we 'll break our arms patting ourselves on the back for how far we 've come . we 'll raise the " @entity34 " banner over the women 's movement . and we 'll call it a day . granted , 80 % of elected officials throughout the country will still be men . women will continue to be less likely than men even to consider running for office . and pay inequities , sexual assault and human trafficking will persist as challenges that no one person can solve , no matter how hard @entity10 might try . " but we 've elected a woman as president , " we 'll say . let her take care of it . a loss would be even more difficult . @entity10 will be blamed for running a subpar campaign regardless of how brilliant her strategy is . more generally , her loss would perpetuate the myth that women can not win big elections , that the electoral environment is rife with bias and discrimination , and that women must be twice as good to get half as far . " if @entity0 ca n't win an election , " potential female candidates will ask , " how can i ? " extrapolating from one female candidate 's experiences to women in politics more broadly is always suspect . but in the case of @entity10 , it is particularly flawed for at least two fundamental reasons . first , @entity10 is no ordinary female presidential candidate , if there is such a thing . she began the 2008 race with levels of name recognition that many candidates never achieve , and she is even more well - known today . but that means that she also enters the electoral arena with 23 years of public accomplishments and 23 years of well - publicized baggage . voters , donors , journalists and pundits all hold clear impressions of @entity10 before she ever eats a corn dog in @entity92 , steps onto a debate stage in @entity94 or takes a shot of bourbon in @entity97 . too often , we treat @entity10 's loss to @entity100 in the 2008 @entity102 primary as a referendum on how citizens feel about electing women to positions of political power . in reality , what people knew about @entity0 likely shaped their views of @entity0 . widespread sexism and misogyny likely did not . after all , for decades , women who have run for office have performed just as well as men . they win elections at equal rates and routinely raise comparable amounts of money . do some voters still question women 's suitability as leaders ? of course they do . but these attitudes , which have become increasingly rare , do not translate into systematic biases against female candidates . second , presidential politics is , first and foremost , a partisan affair . the @entity129 or r in front of the candidates ' names -- not the @entity134 or y chromosomes in their dna -- tells us about how more than 90 % of the population will vote . party polarization has essentially rendered the importance of sex on the campaign trail far less relevant than might otherwise be the case . now , i 'll be the first to predict that by the middle of the week , we will be able to assemble a reel of sexist comments uttered by pundits , and we will be one mouse click away from a steady stream of misogynistic memes , photos and captions that have taken hold on social media . the @entity10 campaign will once again have to determine which incidents to address , which to ignore and how to preempt future episodes . i do n't want to diminish the problems associated with this type of behavior or the fact that it is inappropriate , disrespectful and appalling . and incorporating these concerns into a broad campaign strategy is likely something that male candidates wo n't need to consider . but men yelling " iron my shirt " at a campaign rally , cable news pundits associating @entity10 with their ex-wives outside of probate court and manufacturers producing @entity0 nutcrackers do not change the fact that when it comes to presidential elections , partisanship and the state of the economy tell us almost everything we need to know . if @entity10 wins the race , it will be because it was a good year for @entity102 . and if she loses , it will be because the @entity188 developed a winning message . but how much does any of this really matter ? sure , voters are amenable to electing women . any @entity102 nominee would face the same electoral landscape . the problems confronting women in society are just as grave regardless of who occupies the @entity23 . and inferring too much from @entity0 's experiences is a risky endeavor . yet the minute @entity10 announced her candidacy , she became the official litmus test for true gender equality in the @entity15 . that 's a label that no female candidate should have to wear . let the burden begin .

win or lose , this creates a burden for her that no male candidate will ever have to shoulder*****0
just consider the two potential outcomes*****0
a win would mean a woman in the @entity23 , which is a vital step in the march toward women 's full political inclusion*****1
but it 's possible that the march will end right there*****0
we 'll break our arms patting ourselves on the back for how far we 've come*****0
we 'll raise the " @entity34 " banner over the women 's movement*****1
and we 'll call it a day*****0
granted , 80 % of elected officials throughout the country will still be men*****0
women will continue to be less likely than men even to consider running for office*****0
and pay inequities , sexual assault and human trafficking will persist as challenges that no one person can solve , no matter how hard @entity10 might try*****0
" but we 've elected a woman as president , " we 'll say*****0
let her take care of it*****0

more generally , her loss would perpetuate the myth that women can not win big elections , that the electoral environment is rife with bias and discrimination , and that women must be twice as good to get half as far*****0

but in the case of @entity10 , it is particularly flawed for at least two fundamental reasons*****0
first , @entity10 is no ordinary female presidential candidate , if there is such a thing*****0
she began the 2008 race with levels of name recognition that many candidates never achieve , and she is even more well - known today*****0
but that means that she also enters the electoral arena with 23 years of public accomplishments and 23 years of well - publicized baggage*****0
voters , donors , journalists and pundits all hold clear impressions of @entity10 before she ever eats a corn dog in @entity92 , steps onto a debate stage in @entity94 or takes a shot of bourbon in @entity97*****0
too often , we treat @entity10 's loss to @entity100 in the 2008 @entity102 primary as a referendum on how citizens feel about electing women to positions of political power*****1
in reality , what people knew about @entity0 likely shaped their views of @entity0*****1
widespread sexism and misogyny likely did not*****0
after all , for decades , women who have run for office have performed just as well as men*****0
they win elections at equal rates and routinely raise comparable amounts of money*****0
do some voters still question women 's suitability as leaders ? of course they do*****1
but these attitudes , which have become increasingly rare , do not translate into systematic biases against female candidates*****0
second , presidential politics is , first and foremost , a partisan affair*****0
the @entity129 or r in front of the candidates ' names -- not the @entity134 or y chromosomes in their dna -- tells us about how more than 90 % of the population will vote*****0
party polarization has essentially rendered the importance of sex on the campaign trail far less relevant than might otherwise be the case*****0
now , i 'll be the first to predict that by the middle of the week , we will be able to assemble a reel of sexist comments uttered by pundits , and we will be one mouse click away from a steady stream of misogynistic memes , photos and captions that have taken hold on social media*****0
the @entity10 campaign will once again have to determine which incidents to address , which to ignore and how to preempt future episodes*****0
i do n't want to diminish the problems associated with this type of behavior or the fact that it is inappropriate , disrespectful and appalling*****0
and incorporating these concerns into a broad campaign strategy is likely something that male candidates wo n't need to consider*****0
but men yelling " iron my shirt " at a campaign rally , cable news pundits associating @entity10 with their ex-wives outside of probate court and manufacturers producing @entity0 nutcrackers do not change the fact that when it comes to presidential elections , partisanship and the state of the economy tell us almost everything we need to know*****1
if @entity10 wins the race , it will be because it was a good year for @entity102*****0
and if she loses , it will be because the @entity188 developed a winning message*****0
but how much does any of this really matter ? sure , voters are amenable to electing women*****0
any @entity102 nominee would face the same electoral landscape*****0
the problems confronting women in society are just as grave regardless of who occupies the @entity23*****0
and inferring too much from @entity0 's experiences is a risky endeavor*****1
yet the minute @entity10 announced her candidacy , she became the official litmus test for true gender equality in the @entity15*****1
that 's a label that no female candidate should have to wear*****0
let the burden begin .*****0
