( @entity0 ) when the earthquake hit , many of @entity4 's most renowned pagodas in and around @entity5 crumbled into rubble - covered stumps*****1
others were smothered under splintered hand - carved wooden beams or multi-level rooftops*****0
but the @entity12 's other pagodas , stupas and shrines -- also built mostly of red brick hundreds of years ago -- suffered surprisingly little damage and remained standing next to structures which disappeared*****0
the worst architectural losses have included the majestic @entity20 temple pagoda and its twin , the @entity23 temple pagoda , which dominated @entity5 's main @entity24*****1
from the late 1960s onwards , @entity27 hippy backpackers who traveled the legendary overland route to @entity5 would climb the @entity20 pagoda 's wide , nine - step plinth , sit in the shade under the triple - layered roofs , smoke hashish and enjoy the lofty view*****1
but now the two pagodas have been obliterated and the scene comprises pathetic piles of rubble , a bulldozer shoveling a path for vehicles , shocked and miserable witnesses and a sense of irreplaceable visual and spiritual loss -- unless the structures are eventually rebuilt*****0
the @entity20 temple pagoda may have been hundreds of years old , but before its destruction impoverished rickshaw drivers , coolies and others would publicly urinate into the gutter surrounding it while waiting for passengers or heavy loads to transport*****0
the slightly shorter , triple - roofed @entity23 pagoda allowed vegetable sellers to display their foodstuff on the temple 's broad , five - level base*****0
both pagodas also served as public platforms*****0
jostling crowds of @entity63 and foreigners used to gather there because the plinths ' height above street level allowed excellent views of major @entity70 processions and other events*****0
those two landmarks fronted the enclosed dwelling place of @entity4 's @entity70 virgin goddess , or @entity75 , whose ornate front of bricks , statues and carved wood seem to have survived the initial quakes*****1
it is not immediately known if the inner courtyard and rooms are safe*****0
on the other side of @entity24 , the brick - and - wood @entity85 temple house -- where the @entity70 gods @entity20 and his consort @entity89 -- appear to also have survived*****0
on @entity5 's outskirts the town of @entity91 suffered terrible damage when its central @entity24 lost several pagodas as structures pancaked straight down while others merely shook and cracked*****1
fortunately others appear to still be standing , including the @entity99 temple and a surviving lucky trio of holy structures : the gray stone , @entity104 - influenced @entity103 ; the 17th - century @entity105 with its large stone elephants at the entrance ; and the nearby smaller 17th - century @entity111 " god of the traders " pagoda*****0
several miles away from @entity5 , witnesses have been unable to immediately confirm the levels of destruction which have occurred in the lavish town of @entity117*****0
the locality had undergone years of extensive restoration work thanks to foreign and local artists and funding*****0
the town offset some of that cost by charging tourists a fee to enter its central area , which displayed refined temples , pagodas , shrines and even a restaurant built into a main pagoda , allowing diners to view the best sites while munching their meals*****0
elsewhere in the @entity12 , the white - topped dome of the @entity137 remains standing , but its smaller neighboring stupa has shown some damage from the quake*****0
the @entity137 is prized by @entity143 refugees who have fled their @entity145 - occupied homeland on foot through the @entity148 mountains*****0
they are often seen reverently walking in a circle around the stupa 's base while twirling " prayer wheels " and chanting*****0
there has been no news as yet on damage caused to other famous places of @entity70 and @entity143 worship , including the hilltop swayambhunath temple on the outskirts of @entity5*****0
that imposing structure is popularly known as the " @entity162 " because its often vicious wild monkeys are allowed to scamper among the trees on the temple 's hill , terrifying visitors who have to hike up a lengthy stairway to reach the temples , shrines , shops and monks ' residences*****0
. the fate of the @entity177 complex near @entity5 's international airport is also not known*****1
@entity177 's multiple pagodas and shrines flank its public funeral pyres which emit smoke whenever human corpses are routinely cremated before the ashes are dumped into a narrow river .*****0
