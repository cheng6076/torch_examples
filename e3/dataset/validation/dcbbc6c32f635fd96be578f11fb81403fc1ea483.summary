" it changed me , " said @entity0 , now 28*****0
" there were children with mallets that would go into the riverbed , pick up a big stone and break it into little , little pieces ( to sell )*****0
and they were doing that all day , every day*****0
" @entity0 called her parents and asked them to wire her the $ 5,000 she had earned babysitting*****0

see more @entity25 the @entity25 team traveled to @entity3 and talked to @entity0 about her work and the community she supports*****1
below is an edited version of their conversation*****0
@entity5 : how does it work , raising nearly 50 kids ? @entity0 : it 's communal living , for sure ! we 're a family of almost 50 kids ages 8 months to 16 years*****1
everybody just pitches in and helps each other*****0
they all have their chores*****0
they all have their duties*****0
and everybody cooks the meals together and makes sure that they do their part to make the home run smoothly*****0
the staff at the home , we call them the aunties and the uncles*****0
we wake up in the morning and go off to school*****0
and then come home and do homework and eat our meals together , and everybody goes to bed at night*****0
@entity5 : how does a child come to live in your home ? @entity0 : our first priority as an organization is to keep a child with their family if at all possible*****1
in order to come into the home , you need to have lost both parents , or in some rare cases have suffered extreme neglect , abuse or have a parent who 's incarcerated*****1
we have to conduct a full investigation*****0
so usually that involves going to the child 's village , making calls , doing police checks , getting documentation and paperwork*****0
we have to dig up birth certificates , death certificates , make sure that everything lines up the way that they say it does*****0
@entity5 : meanwhile , you have 350 children attending your school*****1
what is their background ? @entity0 : every single year we 'll get from 1,000 to 1,500 applicants*****0
and we choose the ones who are the most needful and really wo n't be in school without us*****0
most of them live in one room , a mud hut*****0
a lot of them are just in survival mode*****0
we try to relieve the burden from the family , so that the child has food , medical care , books , zero fees for education*****0
@entity5 : what have you learned working with the local community in @entity4 ? @entity0 : i learned very early on , from the beginning , that i could n't come in and just be like , " here , i have a vision*****1
this is what we 're going to do*****0
" that does n't work*****0
it has to be slow ; it has to be organic*****0
and it has to come from the community and be a " we " thing*****0
it 's really important to me that this is a @entity4 project , working for @entity4 , for the community*****1
so the faces that you see are strong @entity4 women and amazing @entity4 role - model men*****0
@entity5 : how does the project continue to grow ? @entity0 : we started with the home and then school*****1
we run the school lunch program*****0
then we needed to keep our kids really healthy , so we started a small clinic and then a counseling center*****0
from there we started getting more sustainable and growing our own food*****0
and then from there we decided to start a women 's center*****0
we just bought a new piece of property to create a totally green and sustainable off - the - grid campus*****0
this year we converted to solar energy*****0
so we 'll have a high school and then a day care , preschool , elementary , all the way up , and a vocational center where kids can become a thriving young adult with everything they need to succeed moving forward*****0
it 's become so much more than just a little girl with a backpack and a big dream*****0
it 's become a community*****0
and i want to teach and have other people take this example and hope this sets a precedent for what our world can be and look like*****0
