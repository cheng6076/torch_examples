@entity1 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) ending a decades - long standstill in @entity6 - @entity5 relations , president @entity0 met for an hour saturday with his @entity5 counterpart @entity7 , the first time the two nations ' top leaders have sat down for substantive talks in more than 50 years . the meeting in a small conference room on the sidelines of the @entity15 came as the two countries work to end the @entity18 enmity that had led to a total freeze of diplomatic ties . and while both leaders proclaimed progress had been made , a key stumbling block -- @entity5 's place on the @entity6 list of countries that sponsor terror -- remained unresolved . " this is obviously an historic meeting , " @entity0 said at the beginning of his session with @entity7 , claiming that decades of strain had done little to benefit either @entity5 or citizens of the @entity6 . " it was time for us to try something new , " he said . ‎ " we are now in a position to move on a path toward the future . " @entity7 , who earlier in the day said he trusted @entity0 , acknowledged there would be difficult stumbling blocks as his nation works to repair ties with the @entity6 . but he said those differences could be surmounted . " we are willing to discuss everything , but we need to be patient , very patient , " @entity7 said . " we might disagree on something today on which we could agree tomorrow . " speaking to reporters after his session with @entity7 , @entity0 said the meeting was " candid and fruitful " and could prove to be a " turning point " in his push to defrost ties with @entity5 . but he said he had n't yet decided whether to remove @entity5 's designation as a state sponsor of terror , an outcome that had previously been expected during the summit . the @entity57 provided @entity0 with a review of the terror status this week . " i want to make sure i have a chance to read it , study it before we announce publicly what the policy outcome is going to be , " @entity0 said . " but in terms of the overall direction of @entity5 policy , i think there is a strong majority both in the @entity6 and in @entity5 that says our ability to engage , to open up commerce and travel and people to people exchanges is ultimately going to be good for @entity5 people . " on friday night , @entity0 and @entity7 greeted each other courteously amid an explosion of camera flashes , shaking hands before dining at the inaugural session of the conference . the two sat at the same table but not directly next to one another . before @entity0 arrived in @entity1 on wednesday , he spoke with @entity7 by phone , laying the groundwork for what will become a new era of relations between the neighboring countries . " @entity18 has been over for a long time , " @entity0 said during opening remarks at the summit saturday . " i 'm not interested in having battles , frankly , that began before i was born . " that exhortation , however , seemed to be lost on @entity7 himself , who expanded what was meant to be a six - minute speech into a 50 - minute address lecturing leaders on @entity5 's revolution and giving a litany of perceived grievances to @entity5 over the past 50 years . but he distinguished @entity0 from past @entity6 presidents , saying he respected @entity0 's move toward reconciliation . " in my opinion , president @entity0 in an honest man , " @entity7 said through an interpreter . " i admire him , and i think his behavior has a lot to do with his humble background . " a @entity6 administration official said @entity7 's long list of grievances was expected , despite the move toward diplomatic ties . " ( what 's ) unique and new is what he said about the president , " the official said of @entity7 's praise for @entity0 . @entity0 announced in december that he was seeking to renew diplomatic relations with @entity5 after half a century of strife , including eventually opening embassies in @entity127 and @entity128 . @entity0 set to test engagement doctrine with @entity5 in @entity1 his meeting with @entity7 on saturday is n't being billed as a formal bilateral session , but @entity0 's aides are still characterizing the event as the highest - level engagement with the @entity5 government since then - vice president @entity136 met with @entity137 in 1959 . " we 're in new territory here , " @entity138 , @entity0 's deputy national security adviser , said friday . " the reason we 're here is because the president strongly believes that an approach that was focused entirely on isolation , focused entirely on seeking to cut off the @entity5 people from the @entity6 had failed . " the overtures to @entity5 have not been universally popular in the @entity6 ; some lawmakers were irate that @entity0 was seeking to engage what they regard as a corrupt government . " a recommendation to remove @entity5 from the list of @entity158 would represent another significant misstep in a misguided policy , " sen. @entity151 , a @entity152 who used to the chair the @entity154 , wrote in a statement last week . in @entity161 , however , @entity0 was receiving a warm welcome after announcing he was seeking to engage @entity128 in talks over reopening embassies and removing barriers to commerce and travel . 9 things you wanted to ask about the @entity5 embargo he noted to applause during a session friday that this was the first summit with @entity5 in attendance . and he 's cast the decision to reopen the @entity6 relationship with @entity5 as beneficial to the entire hemisphere , which has also embraced his immigration executive action . but even as @entity0 landed in @entity1 , the longstanding gulfs between the two countries ' governments were on display . dissidents opposed to @entity7 's regime were violently accosted this week by supporters of the @entity5 government , a scuffle the @entity188 said was unacceptable . " as we move toward the process of normalization , we 'll have our differences , government to government , with @entity5 on many issues -- just as we differ at times with other nations within the @entity199 , just as we differ with our closest allies , " @entity0 said at a meeting of civil society leaders friday . " there 's nothing wrong with that . " " but i 'm here to say that when we do speak out , we 're going to do so because the @entity6 does believe , and will always stand for , a certain set of universal values , " he said . the long history between the @entity6 and @entity5 @entity0 closed out his time in @entity1 with a news conference where he covered topics ranging from @entity211 's expected presidential announcement to his framework deal with @entity213 on its nuclear program . the president had pointed criticism for sen. @entity217 , @entity218 . earlier this week , @entity217 accused secretary of state @entity219 of intentionally mischaracterizing what the sides had agreed to in the @entity213 nuclear deal . " @entity219 is delusional , " @entity217 said on the @entity224 show , a conservative talk radio program , adding that the view from the supreme leader of iran of the provisions agreed to " is probably right , " rather than what the @entity6 maintains are the agreed provisions . while discussing the @entity213 agreement saturday , @entity0 brought up those remarks without being asked . " when i hear someone like sen. @entity217 recently suggest that our secretary of state , @entity219 , who served in the @entity238 , ( is ) a @entity239 veteran , who 's provided exemplary service to this nation , is somehow less trustworthy of the interpretation of what 's in a political agreement than the supreme leader of iran , that 's an indication of the degree to which partisanship has crossed all boundaries , " he said at the news conference . after the president 's remarks , @entity217 tweeted " so pres. @entity0 goes to # @entity1 , meets with @entity7 and attacks me - i 'm sure @entity7 is pleased . " as for his 2008 @entity256 rival , @entity0 said , " if she decides to run , if she makes an announcement , she 's going to have some strong messages to deliver , " he said .
