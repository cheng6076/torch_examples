@entity2 ( @entity3 ) ever written yourself a note , stuffed it in your pocket and headed out into the world only to discover that , somewhere along your journey , the piece of paper has disappeared ? if you live in the @entity11 , there 's a small chance that note has found its way into the hands of 23 - year - old @entity16 . for the past six years , the @entity2 - based artist has scoured the streets of cities and towns looking for those odd bits of paper that flutter to the ground when their owners are n't looking . her quest has uncovered a fascinating , if idiosyncratic , collection of shopping lists , reminders , requests , love notes and motivational musings , all poignant pieces of others ' lives . and now a gallery in @entity2 has put a selection on display for the public . " i was n't intending to start a collection , " she told @entity3 . " i always naturally collected things -- as many artists do -- and it got to the point that i was picking up every one i saw . now i can barely walk down a street without picking up a scrap of paper . " @entity50 began collecting them six years ago after a note caught her eye one rainy night on a walk in her home town of @entity57 , @entity58 . it 's something she confesses has been a lifelong love -- keepsakes ranging from her mother 's cutlery to her own dead goldfish have ended up carefully preserved in her collection for posterity . the notes project , she says , is a culmination of keeping her eyes on the sidewalk and spotting the little things that most people would n't notice as they walked down the street . " i get very odd looks from strangers , " she admits , " but since i 've made friends and families aware of the project , they get very excited when i find one while out with them . " and while some dismiss such behavior as hoarding , @entity50 feels it is part of human nature to hold on to items , no matter how small or insignificant they may seem . " humans want to collect and show to others , " she says . " they want to share and learn from the things they have found . " she says her collecting has led to interesting anthropological insights into the human condition . one of her favorite observations is the evolution of handwriting over the past few decades , from the beautiful copperplate penmanship of the ' 70s to modern teen girl love notes with hearts dotting i 's and multiple exclamation marks . more recently , the note collection has led to an exhibition at @entity108 gallery in @entity2 's @entity109 , where @entity50 works as a shop and studio manager . it showcases a small part of her 1,500 - strong collection . the decision to display the notes came in part from a desire to put them back into the public space . " i always wanted to showcase them , to see what people 's reactions were and if anyone would come forward , " she said . so far two note owners -- one a colleague from the gallery and one an employee from a pub whose beer coasters she had found on her quest -- have revealed themselves as owners of notes . @entity50 gave them framed prints as a thank you . and while some may find the notion of handwritten notes quaint , as social media and smartphones begin to replace handwriting , @entity50 says she finds the note collection an interesting way for an artist to explore people 's lives . " technology is useful , but sometimes the simplest ways are still the best , " she said . " i still usually draw a map rather than relying on technology to get to a place -- and many people are just the same . "
