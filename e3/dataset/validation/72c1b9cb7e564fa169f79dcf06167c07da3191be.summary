( @entity1 ) @entity0 , who appears to have been the only @entity3 citizen held hostage by @entity5 , was accidentally killed in a @entity3 drone strike in january . but it did n't have to be that way . a senior @entity3 official familiar with the handling of the issue told @entity1 that the @entity3 government made no serious effort to negotiate for the 73 - year - old development expert 's release , either directly to @entity5 or through proxies in @entity17 . another senior @entity3 official told @entity1 that @entity0 's capture by @entity5 made it hard for the @entity3 to negotiate , even though proxies such as the @entity17 government have links to intermediaries who might have helped . a senior @entity17 official told @entity1 that after @entity0 was kidnapped , the @entity17 government put out feelers to members of the militant @entity29 and to the @entity17 @entity30 , which are both allied to @entity5 , to see if these groups might be able to initiate some kind of negotiation about @entity0 . according to the official , nothing came of those feelers . the senior @entity17 official says that during the past year @entity17 soldiers , who were part of a military offensive in the tribal area of @entity41 near the @entity43 - @entity17 border where @entity0 was believed to be being held , went door - to - door looking for the @entity3 . nothing came of this search either . on thursday , the @entity3 government announced that @entity0 had been killed in a " counterterrorism operation " in january , which is how the government often describes @entity49 drone strikes . according to @entity56 , which tracks drone strikes in @entity17 , @entity49 drone attacks happened in @entity59 , @entity41 , on january 19 in which at least four militants were killed ; also on january 15 in @entity52 , @entity53 , in which at least five militants were killed ; and on january 4 in @entity55 , @entity53 , in which at least eight militants were killed . it is in one of these strikes that @entity0 was almost certainly killed . lt. col. @entity65 , a planner on the @entity67 staff , is under investigation over a purported unauthorized disclosure to @entity3 rep. @entity71 's office , which has demonstrated a strong interest in the fate of @entity3 hostages held by @entity5 and the @entity30 . a plan was developed in the @entity76 to secure the release of @entity0 , according to a staff member on @entity71 's committee . that plan was to release @entity80 , a prominent and influential member of the @entity30 who is in prison in the @entity3 on drug trafficking charges , in exchange for @entity67 sgt. @entity84 , who was held by the @entity30 until last year ; @entity30 hostages @entity86 , a @entity3 citizen , and her husband , @entity90 @entity89 ; and dr. @entity91 , who spied for the @entity49 in @entity17 and was being held in a @entity17 prison , as well as @entity0 . it 's not clear how far this plan of action went . @entity65 is invoking whistleblower protection and denies making an unauthorized disclosure . @entity71 , a @entity99 @entity98 , released a statement thursday , saying , " the only government organization seriously developing options to recover @entity0 and others in the @entity43 / @entity17 region was within the @entity76 -- led by war hero @entity65 . " as an @entity67 captain , @entity65 led a small detachment of @entity107 into @entity43 in november 2001 in the wake of the september 11 attacks on the @entity3 . the operation was instrumental in helping to topple the @entity30 and to install @entity111 as the new leader of @entity43 . who exactly carried out @entity0 's kidnapping from his house 3½ years ago in the @entity17 megacity of @entity117 has until now not been clear . a senior @entity17 counterterrorism official told @entity1 that members of the @entity120 , or @entity120 , kidnapped @entity0 at his @entity117 home on august 13 , 2011 . @entity120 is an @entity122 terrorist group headquartered in the tribal regions of @entity17 along its border with @entity43 . according to the @entity17 official , the leader of the @entity127 kidnapping cell was a relative of @entity129 , the former @entity120 leader killed in a @entity49 drone strike in the @entity17 tribal regions in 2009 . the initial lead that traced the @entity0 kidnapping to the @entity120 came from another high - profile kidnapping in @entity17 two weeks after @entity0 's abduction . @entity136 , the son of a leading @entity17 liberal politician @entity137 -- who was killed by @entity17 militants eight months earlier -- was kidnapped in @entity117 on august 26 , 2011 . at the scene of @entity137 's kidnapping one of the kidnappers dropped a cell phone and sim card that eventually led @entity17 officials to focus on the @entity120 group in @entity117 , according to the senior @entity17 counterterrorism official . the police subsequently arrested three @entity122 and four @entity17 who were part of the @entity120 cell that had carried out the @entity0 kidnapping . members of the @entity120 cell told @entity17 interrogators that after they had kidnapped @entity0 they moved him while he was tranquilized and semi-conscious among three safe houses in @entity117 . @entity120 members then took @entity0 to the @entity154 in @entity17 , a semi-autonomous region along the border with @entity43 where @entity5 and other militant groups are headquartered . there @entity0 was given or , more likely , sold to @entity5 , according to the senior @entity17 official . who was @entity0 ? @entity0 had spent his life helping others , working in the fields of aid and development . he held a doctorate in international law and economics from @entity168 and spoke more than half a dozen languages . after his capture , the leader of @entity5 , @entity171 , demanded the end of @entity49 drone strikes in @entity17 and the release of terrorists held in @entity3 custody in exchange for @entity0 's freedom . on september 12 , 2012 , @entity0 appeared in a video produced by @entity5 's production arm in which he said that the @entity183 administration had shown " no interest in my case . " he then appealed to @entity187 prime minister @entity186 from " one jew to another " to intervene . the @entity183 administration is in the midst of a review of its hostage policy , which has been criticized by some families whose loved ones have been taken hostage by @entity195 , @entity5 or the @entity30 . the key problems these families point to are lack of communication by the @entity3 government about their loved ones and a lack of coordination within the government about how best to free them . the @entity49 , for instance , is focused on drone strikes and counterterrorism operations , while the @entity208 has responsibility for retrieving @entity3 hostages . often these goals are not in alignment -- as was clearly the case with @entity0 . the @entity49 could have exercised more due diligence knowing that @entity0 was almost certainly being held in @entity41 . there are some solutions for these problems . first , families should be granted security clearances by the @entity3 government for the purpose of having classified information disclosed to them only about their captive loved ones . right now , the @entity3 government wo n't communicate much with the families about their loved ones because the relatives do n't have the requisite security clearances . should families abuse their clearances , they would no longer receive classified information about their loved ones , which is a strong incentive not to abuse them . second , president @entity183 should appoint a senior - level person , perhaps working in the @entity232 on the @entity233 , to oversee the work of the @entity49 , @entity208 , @entity235 and the @entity236 , which implements hostage rescues . all these organizations have key roles to play in getting @entity3 hostages home . that person must be sufficiently senior so he or she can make all the relevant agencies play well together and " de-conflict " any potential issues , such as the ones that surfaced in the @entity0 case . third , while the @entity3 government position is that it will not make concessions to terrorist groups , there is nothing in @entity3 policy to prevent another government from negotiating with terrorists to secure the release of @entity3 citizens , and this should be encouraged , even if there is some quid pro quo involved . this is what happened in the case of the @entity3 journalist @entity263 , who was captured by @entity5 's affiliate in @entity265 in 2012 , but was released last year after the @entity267 government intervened in his case . the @entity267 have had longstanding ties to the militant groups in @entity265 , including the @entity5 affiliate holding @entity263 , and while @entity267 officials have denied paying ransom to free @entity263 , it 's unlikely that the journalist was freed just because the members of @entity5 holding him were suddenly feeling like good guys . @entity263 ' successful release could provide a ray of hope for @entity3 citizen @entity86 and her husband , @entity90 @entity89 , who were captured by the @entity30 in 2012 when they were traveling on a trip through @entity43 . a senior @entity3 official told @entity1 they are being held by the @entity29 . the @entity17 government has contacts with the @entity29 , and the @entity3 government should ratchet up the pressure on the @entity17 government to secure the couple 's release . in captivity , @entity291 , who was pregnant at the time she was taken hostage , had a child . the name of the child is unknown .

( @entity1 ) @entity0 , who appears to have been the only @entity3 citizen held hostage by @entity5 , was accidentally killed in a @entity3 drone strike in january*****1
but it did n't have to be that way*****0
a senior @entity3 official familiar with the handling of the issue told @entity1 that the @entity3 government made no serious effort to negotiate for the 73 - year - old development expert 's release , either directly to @entity5 or through proxies in @entity17*****0
another senior @entity3 official told @entity1 that @entity0 's capture by @entity5 made it hard for the @entity3 to negotiate , even though proxies such as the @entity17 government have links to intermediaries who might have helped*****1
a senior @entity17 official told @entity1 that after @entity0 was kidnapped , the @entity17 government put out feelers to members of the militant @entity29 and to the @entity17 @entity30 , which are both allied to @entity5 , to see if these groups might be able to initiate some kind of negotiation about @entity0*****0
according to the official , nothing came of those feelers*****0
the senior @entity17 official says that during the past year @entity17 soldiers , who were part of a military offensive in the tribal area of @entity41 near the @entity43 - @entity17 border where @entity0 was believed to be being held , went door - to - door looking for the @entity3*****1
nothing came of this search either*****0
on thursday , the @entity3 government announced that @entity0 had been killed in a " counterterrorism operation " in january , which is how the government often describes @entity49 drone strikes*****1
according to @entity56 , which tracks drone strikes in @entity17 , @entity49 drone attacks happened in @entity59 , @entity41 , on january 19 in which at least four militants were killed ; also on january 15 in @entity52 , @entity53 , in which at least five militants were killed ; and on january 4 in @entity55 , @entity53 , in which at least eight militants were killed*****0
it is in one of these strikes that @entity0 was almost certainly killed*****1
lt. col. @entity65 , a planner on the @entity67 staff , is under investigation over a purported unauthorized disclosure to @entity3 rep. @entity71 's office , which has demonstrated a strong interest in the fate of @entity3 hostages held by @entity5 and the @entity30*****1
a plan was developed in the @entity76 to secure the release of @entity0 , according to a staff member on @entity71 's committee*****0
that plan was to release @entity80 , a prominent and influential member of the @entity30 who is in prison in the @entity3 on drug trafficking charges , in exchange for @entity67 sgt. @entity84 , who was held by the @entity30 until last year ; @entity30 hostages @entity86 , a @entity3 citizen , and her husband , @entity90 @entity89 ; and dr. @entity91 , who spied for the @entity49 in @entity17 and was being held in a @entity17 prison , as well as @entity0*****1
it 's not clear how far this plan of action went*****0
@entity65 is invoking whistleblower protection and denies making an unauthorized disclosure*****0
@entity71 , a @entity99 @entity98 , released a statement thursday , saying , " the only government organization seriously developing options to recover @entity0 and others in the @entity43 / @entity17 region was within the @entity76 -- led by war hero @entity65*****0
" as an @entity67 captain , @entity65 led a small detachment of @entity107 into @entity43 in november 2001 in the wake of the september 11 attacks on the @entity3*****0
the operation was instrumental in helping to topple the @entity30 and to install @entity111 as the new leader of @entity43*****0
who exactly carried out @entity0 's kidnapping from his house 3½ years ago in the @entity17 megacity of @entity117 has until now not been clear*****0
a senior @entity17 counterterrorism official told @entity1 that members of the @entity120 , or @entity120 , kidnapped @entity0 at his @entity117 home on august 13 , 2011*****0
@entity120 is an @entity122 terrorist group headquartered in the tribal regions of @entity17 along its border with @entity43*****0
according to the @entity17 official , the leader of the @entity127 kidnapping cell was a relative of @entity129 , the former @entity120 leader killed in a @entity49 drone strike in the @entity17 tribal regions in 2009*****1
the initial lead that traced the @entity0 kidnapping to the @entity120 came from another high - profile kidnapping in @entity17 two weeks after @entity0 's abduction*****0
@entity136 , the son of a leading @entity17 liberal politician @entity137 -- who was killed by @entity17 militants eight months earlier -- was kidnapped in @entity117 on august 26 , 2011*****0
at the scene of @entity137 's kidnapping one of the kidnappers dropped a cell phone and sim card that eventually led @entity17 officials to focus on the @entity120 group in @entity117 , according to the senior @entity17 counterterrorism official*****0
the police subsequently arrested three @entity122 and four @entity17 who were part of the @entity120 cell that had carried out the @entity0 kidnapping*****0
members of the @entity120 cell told @entity17 interrogators that after they had kidnapped @entity0 they moved him while he was tranquilized and semi-conscious among three safe houses in @entity117*****0
@entity120 members then took @entity0 to the @entity154 in @entity17 , a semi-autonomous region along the border with @entity43 where @entity5 and other militant groups are headquartered*****0
there @entity0 was given or , more likely , sold to @entity5 , according to the senior @entity17 official*****0
who was @entity0 ? @entity0 had spent his life helping others , working in the fields of aid and development*****0
he held a doctorate in international law and economics from @entity168 and spoke more than half a dozen languages*****0
after his capture , the leader of @entity5 , @entity171 , demanded the end of @entity49 drone strikes in @entity17 and the release of terrorists held in @entity3 custody in exchange for @entity0 's freedom*****1
on september 12 , 2012 , @entity0 appeared in a video produced by @entity5 's production arm in which he said that the @entity183 administration had shown " no interest in my case*****0
" he then appealed to @entity187 prime minister @entity186 from " one jew to another " to intervene*****0
the @entity183 administration is in the midst of a review of its hostage policy , which has been criticized by some families whose loved ones have been taken hostage by @entity195 , @entity5 or the @entity30*****1
the key problems these families point to are lack of communication by the @entity3 government about their loved ones and a lack of coordination within the government about how best to free them*****0
the @entity49 , for instance , is focused on drone strikes and counterterrorism operations , while the @entity208 has responsibility for retrieving @entity3 hostages*****0
often these goals are not in alignment -- as was clearly the case with @entity0*****0
the @entity49 could have exercised more due diligence knowing that @entity0 was almost certainly being held in @entity41*****1
there are some solutions for these problems*****0
first , families should be granted security clearances by the @entity3 government for the purpose of having classified information disclosed to them only about their captive loved ones*****0
right now , the @entity3 government wo n't communicate much with the families about their loved ones because the relatives do n't have the requisite security clearances*****0
should families abuse their clearances , they would no longer receive classified information about their loved ones , which is a strong incentive not to abuse them*****0
second , president @entity183 should appoint a senior - level person , perhaps working in the @entity232 on the @entity233 , to oversee the work of the @entity49 , @entity208 , @entity235 and the @entity236 , which implements hostage rescues*****0
all these organizations have key roles to play in getting @entity3 hostages home*****0
that person must be sufficiently senior so he or she can make all the relevant agencies play well together and " de-conflict " any potential issues , such as the ones that surfaced in the @entity0 case*****0
third , while the @entity3 government position is that it will not make concessions to terrorist groups , there is nothing in @entity3 policy to prevent another government from negotiating with terrorists to secure the release of @entity3 citizens , and this should be encouraged , even if there is some quid pro quo involved*****1
this is what happened in the case of the @entity3 journalist @entity263 , who was captured by @entity5 's affiliate in @entity265 in 2012 , but was released last year after the @entity267 government intervened in his case*****0
the @entity267 have had longstanding ties to the militant groups in @entity265 , including the @entity5 affiliate holding @entity263 , and while @entity267 officials have denied paying ransom to free @entity263 , it 's unlikely that the journalist was freed just because the members of @entity5 holding him were suddenly feeling like good guys*****0
@entity263 ' successful release could provide a ray of hope for @entity3 citizen @entity86 and her husband , @entity90 @entity89 , who were captured by the @entity30 in 2012 when they were traveling on a trip through @entity43*****0
a senior @entity3 official told @entity1 they are being held by the @entity29*****1
the @entity17 government has contacts with the @entity29 , and the @entity3 government should ratchet up the pressure on the @entity17 government to secure the couple 's release*****0
in captivity , @entity291 , who was pregnant at the time she was taken hostage , had a child*****0
the name of the child is unknown .*****0
