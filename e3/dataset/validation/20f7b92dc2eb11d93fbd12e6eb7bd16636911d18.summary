the greenback 's strength allows producers to import crops that may be withering under the absence of @entity67 rain or other misfortunes elsewhere in the nation , @entity48 said*****0
moreover , the drop in oil prices also eases the cost of transporting food from @entity6 to the other 49 states , she said*****0
what economists do n't know yet is whether farmers will plant fewer crops because of the drought*****0
those decisions are now being made in the field and could boost supermarket prices , she said*****0
