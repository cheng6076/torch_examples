( @entity5 ) a term used by president @entity1 and @entity3 mayor @entity2 to characterize rioters has given new life to a debate over the word " thug . " " of course it 's not the right word , to call our children ' thugs , ' " @entity3 councilman @entity15 told @entity5 's " @entity16 . " " these are children who have been set aside , marginalized , who have not been engaged by us . no , we do n't have to call them thugs . " " just call them n --- -- s. just call them n --- -- s , " he said . " no , we do n't have to call them by names such as that . " the rev. @entity25 drew the same comparison wednesday morning on @entity5 . the president and the mayor are wrong , he said . " these are not thugs , these are upset and frustrated children . " " it 's amazing . you do n't call six police officers who kill a man without probable cause ' thugs , ' but children who are frustrated and do n't have an outlet , you call them ' thugs . ' ' thugs ' is the 21st century word for the n - word . and it is repulsive and it is offensive to every person who is a parent trying to raise children interpreting what 's taking place in this hour . " the recent unrest in @entity3 was sparked by the arrest and death of @entity53 , who suffered a severe spinal cord injury while in custody . six officers have been suspended over the incident . @entity25 delivered the eulogy at @entity53 's funeral . what we know , do n't know about @entity53 's death mayor @entity2 responded wednesday . " i wanted to clarify my comments on ' thugs , ' " she wrote wednesday on @entity64 . " when you speak out of frustration and anger , one can say things in a way that you do n't mean . " she added , " that night we saw misguided young people who need to be held accountable , but who also need support . and my comments then did n't convey that . " @entity78 , @entity3 native and former president of the @entity80 , said , " it 's important we not shift the focus into something that has absolutely nothing to do with poverty , despair , hunger , homelessness and a sense of not belonging . " " whether we call them a thug , a law breaker , a juvenile delinquent , it really does n't matter . what matters is how do we take back our streets . and that 's what men have been doing , going around , talking to these young men where they , are in their face , and letting them know , you ca n't control this community . it is not yours . you ca n't burn it down . you ca n't force people out . you ca n't threaten people , " he told " @entity16 . " " so i understand that , that people want to talk about a word . but i 'm more worried about a movement , and it 's not necessarily a movement for positive change . it 's a movement for negative change right now unless we get it under control . " @entity124 , another @entity3 native and author of " @entity126 , " said " thug " is " not like the n - word in my mind . " but , he said in a @entity5 interview , the term has " been racialized across @entity131 , so i can see why people would become offended like that .

" these were young juveniles . and so , in my mind i do n't see a 16 - or 17 - year - old as a thug . i have seen thugs , and they do n't look like thugs to me . my experience in life has been a little bit more extreme than that , but , again , it was criminal behavior and it ca n't be justified .
