" this is a powerful attack capability , and we are curious about the risk and benefit analysis that led the @entity1 government to reveal it with this highly visible denial of service attack , " said researcher @entity31 . the reason @entity1 censors are taking that risk : free - speech cyberactivists have found ways to get around the @entity9 and give @entity1 readers greater access to the @entity45 's free press . enter the " @entity22 .

" a modest technical change could turn the @entity22 into a malware delivery device for infecting the computer of a target individual anywhere in the world who visits a @entity1 server , " @entity31 said . this might include all emails headed in and out of @entity1 , he said .
