( @entity1 ) as @entity0 mark the 150th anniversary of @entity4 's death this week , let us remember that he not only belongs to the ages , but also belongs , in a special way , to @entity9 . @entity4 's two greatest legacies -- indivisible union and irreversible emancipation -- grew organically from his @entity14 roots . he knew firsthand that no defensible border shielded the land of corn from the land of cotton . the entire region from the @entity21 to the @entity22 drained through the @entity23 , enabling farmers in this vast basin to float their goods down to market through @entity28 and from there to the world . he thus could never allow a potentially hostile power to control this geostrategic chokepoint in particular , or @entity32 more generally . the @entity0 landmass , he insisted , " is well adapted to be the home of one national family ; and it is not well adapted for two , or more " because " there is no line , straight or crooked , suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide . " @entity4 supplemented his @entity14 geography lesson with a distinctly @entity14 claim about constitutional history : " @entity43 is older than any of the @entity44 ; and in fact , it created them as @entity0 .

( @entity1 ) as @entity0 mark the 150th anniversary of @entity4 's death this week , let us remember that he not only belongs to the ages , but also belongs , in a special way , to @entity9*****1
@entity4 's two greatest legacies -- indivisible union and irreversible emancipation -- grew organically from his @entity14 roots*****1
he knew firsthand that no defensible border shielded the land of corn from the land of cotton*****0
the entire region from the @entity21 to the @entity22 drained through the @entity23 , enabling farmers in this vast basin to float their goods down to market through @entity28 and from there to the world*****0
he thus could never allow a potentially hostile power to control this geostrategic chokepoint in particular , or @entity32 more generally*****0
the @entity0 landmass , he insisted , " is well adapted to be the home of one national family ; and it is not well adapted for two , or more " because " there is no line , straight or crooked , suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide*****0
" @entity4 supplemented his @entity14 geography lesson with a distinctly @entity14 claim about constitutional history : " @entity43 is older than any of the @entity44 ; and in fact , it created them as @entity0*****1
" @entity4 did not need to make this controversial claim to prove his case , and elsewhere he stressed the decisive legal point that the @entity51 's text clearly prohibits unilateral secession*****1
the @entity51 is always and everywhere the supreme law of the land -- no matter what an individual state says*****0
but @entity4 's additional assertion that the @entity43 created the states , not vice versa , provoked strong disagreement in other parts of the country*****1
most virginians , including @entity62 gen. @entity61 , insisted that of course @entity63 had come first ! at the outbreak of the @entity67 , the @entity65 was already a century and a half old*****0
generations of @entity70 had helped govern @entity63 long before the @entity0 was born*****0
but if @entity61 was , first and always , a @entity63 , @entity4 was an @entity0*****1
his father came from @entity63 , his grandfather hailed from @entity73 , and before that , the family had probably lived in @entity76*****0
@entity77 himself had been born in @entity79 and had moved as a boy to @entity81 , and later , as a young man , to @entity9*****0
these latter two @entity14 states had undeniably been formed by the @entity43 itself*****0
these places had begun as federal territory -- the common inheritance of all @entity0 -- and it was the federal government that had indeed brought these new states to life*****1
when young @entity77 moved to @entity81 , it was just becoming a state , thanks to federal governmental action*****0
it was a wise set of federal policies -- proper land surveys and a commitment to public education -- that had drawn the @entity100 and countless other @entity101 to leave the @entity79 for a brighter future in the @entity14*****1
retracing @entity4 's assassination 150 years later that brighter future also involved freedom from slavery*****1
the @entity106 had always been free soil , as provided for by a @entity107 that predated the @entity0 @entity51*****0
the words of the 13th amendment -- the only constitutional amendment that @entity4 would live to sign -- promised to end slavery everywhere in @entity0 and did so by borrowing verbatim from @entity111 6 of the @entity107*****1
true , geography is not inexorable destiny*****0
many other midwesterners in @entity4 's era embraced slavery and secession*****1
@entity118 , the @entity120 justice who did the most to make @entity4 's constitutional vision a reality over the next century , was born and raised in @entity124*****1
but geographic variation has always been a large part of @entity0 's constitutional saga*****1
in the 1860 election that brought him to power , @entity4 swept almost all the @entity131 states , but did miserably in the slaveholding south*****0
@entity133 , the dastard who ended @entity4 's life 150 years ago this week , was an embittered extremist from a slave state*****1
so was @entity4 's nemesis on the @entity120 , chief justice @entity140*****1
@entity140 's most infamous ruling , the pro-slavery @entity143 decision in 1857 , had emerged from a court dominated by the @entity145 ; although slave states accounted for less a third of @entity0 's free population , this region held an absolute majority of the seats on the court*****1
remembering @entity4 's murder in our era , given the fact that @entity156 appointees have held a majority of the court for the last 40 years , the court has been rather moderate*****1
much of this moderation has come courtesy of northern @entity156 on the @entity120 -- most notably , @entity164 's @entity163 , @entity9 ' @entity165 , and @entity166 's @entity162*****0
all nine of the current justices learned their law in liberal @entity76 , at @entity170 or @entity171 , and the @entity156 appointee most attentive to gay rights , @entity172 , grew up in northern @entity174 , a corner of the country renowned for its respect for alternative lifestyles*****0
which takes us back to @entity4*****0
when @entity172 was a lad in @entity174 's state capital , the governor , a friend of the @entity172 family , was a @entity4 @entity156 named @entity184 -- a man who would later author the @entity120 's iconic opinion in @entity189 , vindicating the constitutional amendments enshrined by @entity4 and his allies*****1
today , both parties at their best claim @entity4*****0
@entity194 aims to appeal to the better angels of our nature and @entity198 is a @entity79 who professes interest in racial outreach*****0
@entity202 was born an @entity9 @entity156*****0
and the leader of her adopted political party -- who also happens to be president -- is a lanky and brainy lawyer from @entity9 who knows how to give a good speech , and who swept to power in 2008 by recreating @entity4 's geographic coalition , winning every state within a four - hour drive of @entity212*****1
in the largest sense , then , all @entity0 , of both parties and all regions -- whether or not they have ever set foot in @entity9 -- are living in the @entity9 .*****0
