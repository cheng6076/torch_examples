" it was just laying down just right like that , boom , " @entity10 told @entity0 affiliate @entity11 . " i pass here five , six times a day because i live two blocks from here and when i looked i could n't believe it , to see that it was tipped over . " @entity10 said he 's tended to the grave site at the @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 , since @entity6 was buried there in 1993 . police are investigating , but no other headstones were knocked over . police chief @entity26 told the @entity27 that he suspects vandalism . " i 'm not sure how else it would have fallen over , " he said . still , police will look into the possibility that it was weather - related . funeral director @entity32 also said vandalism is the most - likely cause , not the weather .
