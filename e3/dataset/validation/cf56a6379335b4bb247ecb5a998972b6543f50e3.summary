" gangs of criminals are putting people on a boat , sometimes even at gunpoint , " @entity28 prime minister @entity27 said . " they 're putting them on the road to death , really , and nothing else . " a rescue operation is still underway for people who were on the ship from @entity16 , and the number of potential victims is not clear . a @entity45 survivor told investigators there were 950 people on board . previous estimates put the number around 700 . @entity28 authorities , who are working with @entity3 rescuers , said around 50 people had been saved . but the @entity3 @entity56 said 28 people had been rescued and 24 bodies recovered . two of the survivors were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking upon arriving in @entity62 , according to @entity3 police officer @entity63 . on monday , @entity65 ministers met in @entity66 and proposed a 10 - point plan to help address the crisis . " we are not yet working on numbers , but what we have agreed on today is , for sure , the need to increase significantly the resources at sea , and the level of the operation , doing more search and rescue and doing it more together , " @entity69 told @entity5 's " @entity79 with @entity80 . " the @entity65 high representative for foreign affairs and security policy said the @entity65 must fight human traffickers , strengthen @entity17 ' duty to save lives at sea and share responsibility when it comes to the resettlement and relocation of refugees .
