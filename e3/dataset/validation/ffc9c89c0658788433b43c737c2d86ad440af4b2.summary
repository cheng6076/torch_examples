@entity1 , @entity2 ( @entity3 ) there are plenty of details left to iron out , but negotiators took a significant step thursday toward a landmark deal aimed at keeping @entity9 's nuclear program peaceful . after a marathon stretch of late - night negotiations in @entity1 , @entity2 , diplomats announced they 'd come up with the framework for an agreement that 's been months in the making . @entity9 would reduce its stockpile of low - enriched uranium by 98 % and significantly scale back its number of installed centrifuges , according to the plan . in exchange , the @entity21 and the @entity22 would lift sanctions that have crippled the country 's economy . " it is a good deal , a deal that meets our core objectives , " @entity21 president @entity27 said in a speech from the @entity29 . " this framework would cut off every pathway that @entity9 could take to develop a nuclear weapon . " the deal would include strict verification measures to make sure @entity9 complies , he said . " if @entity9 cheats , " @entity27 said , " the world will know it . " key points of the deal the world powers involved in the talks with @entity9 were the @entity21 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , the @entity48 and @entity49 . for the @entity21 and @entity9 , two countries with a long history of strained relations , the negotiations took on an added significance . just two years ago , they had n't talked with each other officially in nearly four decades . " i think there was a seriousness of purpose , " @entity21 secretary of state @entity57 told @entity3 in an interview shortly after the framework was announced . " people negotiated hard . it was tough , very intense at times , sometimes emotional and confrontational . it was a very intensive process , because the stakes are very high , and because there is a long history of not talking to each other . for 35 years , we have n't talked with the @entity9 directly like this . " on thursday , @entity9 state television broadcast @entity27 's speech live , something many @entity9 described as unprecedented . some @entity9 marked the historic moment in @entity21 - @entity9 relations on @entity78 by sharing " selfies " of themselves in front of the live @entity27 speech . but @entity21 leaders were still talking tough , even as they praised the agreement . @entity57 stressed that if a final deal is reached with @entity9 , the removal of any sanctions against @entity86 will come in phases .

meanwhile , as talks dragged on , the @entity21 , the @entity22 and others imposed sanctions on @entity9 , provoking resentment among @entity86 's leaders , who called the sanctions a crime against humanity*****1
the challenge all along was twofold : to assure the international community that @entity9 could not develop nuclear weapons ( which it denied in any event that it was doing ) ; and to accommodate the country 's assertion of its right -- as a signer of the @entity234 -- to enrich nuclear fuel for civilian purposes*****1
