@entity2 ( @entity1 ) @entity0 's running out for @entity3 to decide who they 'll back , as polling booths prepare to open across the country in an election that could change the political landscape*****1
it 's been a blink - and - you - miss - it campaign , especially by @entity13 standards , where candidates can take years to finesse their messages*****1
the election could result in the handing of power from @entity21 's @entity20 government to the @entity22 , led by @entity23 -- or a frenzy of wrangling from leaders as they attempt to forge alliances with smaller parties*****1
but that 's all to come when polls close late thursday evening , local time*****0
very strict rules govern the reporting of @entity3 elections , but until they kick in , here are some things you should know -- who are the candidates , what are the issues , who 's likely to win , why bacon sandwiches matter , what is " @entity46 " and , if the @entity44 is n't in charge , what does she do ? the @entity44 does n't run @entity3 before we get on to the candidates , let 's dispel one common misconception*****1
@entity44 is officially @entity3 's head of state , but she 's only nominally in charge*****1
she signs off on legislation and appoints new prime ministers but has no real power , so no beheadings but maybe a few disapproving stares*****0
officially , she 's politically neutral*****0
the closest she apparently comes to expressing opinion is -- savor this image -- " purring " like a cat*****0
visit : @entity61 , the @entity44 's country residence ( @entity63 and @entity64 ; +44 20 7766 7304 ) , royalcollection.org.uk / visit / windsorcastle so who are they voting for ? duh , they 're voting for a new prime minister*****1
well , actually no. in presidential elections @entity13 vote in each state for " electors , " who support the candidate they want to lead the country*****0
but in a @entity3 parliamentary the vote is more indirectly aimed at appointing a new government*****0
voters put their " x " next to the local stooge / aspiring public servant from whichever political party they support*****0
votes are tallied by constituencies -- political fiefdoms , really -- some of which date back centuries to when @entity3 was run by barons , or maybe even elves -- each with a seat in parliament*****0
the party that wins most seats then gets to say who becomes prime minister , pending the final thumbs up from her majesty*****0
of course , in reality , people may be swayed by party figureheads and see voting as a direct endorsement of their leadership , personality or -- true things -- their ability to eat bacon sandwiches and point at fish*****1
visit : @entity114 -- a beautiful north @entity2 green space that lies partly within the @entity114 and @entity117 constituency , likely to be one of the most hotly contested of the election*****0

is that a fair system ? kinda*****0
but also kinda not , since it means a party can easily win power without winning the most votes*****0
that 's because @entity3 's elections are run on a " first - past - the - post " basis*****1

no prizes for second place*****0

the stunning islands of the @entity167 , off the western coast of mainland @entity169 , are part of the @entity3 's smallest constituency by voter numbers*****1
visitscotland.com / info / towns - villages / luskentyre - sands so who 's going to win ? @entity3 elections are typically viewed as a two - horse race -- an analogy that highlights how similar they are to races involving two horses , only with fewer horses*****1
the prime candidates are incumbent @entity21 , head of the center - right conservatives , and @entity23 , leader of the center - left @entity22*****0
opinion polls say there 's no clear favorite*****0
that 'll mean -- as it did in 2010 -- that the spoils of victory could be claimed by whoever can successfully horse ( yes , horse ) trade to build a majority coalition alongside smaller parties*****0
if that happens , eyes will be on the smaller parties including the @entity203 , the @entity156 and the upstart @entity3 @entity204*****0
@entity46 's leader @entity205 is a political outsider who 's won support for being anti-immigration , anti-europe and pro-beer*****0
his party is n't expected to win many seats , but it could result in some unlikely romancing -- as the last vote did when the @entity156 hopped into bed with the @entity161 , much to the anger of some supporters*****1
visit : @entity218*****0
enough with the horse analogies already*****0
check out the real thing at the @entity44 's favorite track*****1
@entity222 , @entity218 , @entity223 , ascot.co.uk what are the issues ? there 's the future of @entity3 's cherished yet financially challenged @entity229 -- the free medicare system that 's undergone so many botched political procedures in recent years , it can barely bring itself to take off the bandages*****1
@entity46 's rise has spurred uncomfortable cross-party pledges to beef up controls to end decades of population - swelling immigration , a concern , apparently , among @entity3 's descendants of @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity243 invaders*****1
there 's the economy -- how to tackle @entity3 's budget deficit and foster financial recovery ( without relying on the cheap immigrant labor that the politicians want to stop entering*****1
) and there 's @entity251 -- another @entity46 - generated issue that has forced the main parties into posturing against the @entity255 , even though many supporters suspect withdrawing would be disastrous , not just for the economy , but for future fish - pointing opportunities*****0

political apathy is on the rise in the @entity3 , with many younger voters expressing disillusionment with party leaders they say are out of touch and barely distinguishable from one another , even if one " looks like a panda " and the other a " pink condom*****0

" however , he later changed his mind after meeting @entity23 , and urged people to vote @entity22*****0
still , @entity3 elections are n't without their entertainment -- most notably provided by fringe candidates*****1
from 1963 until 1995 , a feature of every vote count was @entity298 , an odd - looking pop star whose @entity299 campaigned for many lost causes that later became reality , such as commercial radio and the scrapping of dog licenses*****0
in the 2010 election other eccentric candidates included @entity307 , who campaigned on policies that included the appointment of @entity311 as @entity312*****1
@entity313 also pledged to train schoolchildren in " swordsmanship and gunnery " by imposing a 50 % tax on downloads of @entity320 songs " because i hate @entity320*****0
" whatever their motivation , come election night when they get their moment on stage with serious political rivals , they often get better laughs than @entity287*****0
visit : @entity329*****0
this charming @entity331 seaside town is where @entity205 will be standing for election*****0
among his opponents is @entity335 -- a comedian whose boorish stage character , " @entity338 , " shares many of the @entity46 leader 's views*****0
