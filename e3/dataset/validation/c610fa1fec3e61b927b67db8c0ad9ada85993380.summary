" i had tried to collect ( rain ) water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat , " @entity3 said . " the waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad . " finally the conditions were right . i filled up my water tank , which is 25 gallons . i filled up a bucket . " then there was the issue of food . the fish were n't cooperating , but after a while @entity3 learned that they were attracted to his laundry that he would put out to sea for a rinse . the fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net , he said . @entity84 came ashore thursday evening . @entity0 affiliate @entity85 in @entity86 , @entity87 , reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into @entity89 at about 7:30 p.m. @entity3 was reported missing january 29 , a few days after his last contact with his father . two months of concern poured out in a phone call with his son 's rescuers . @entity3 thanked the captain of the @entity17 .
