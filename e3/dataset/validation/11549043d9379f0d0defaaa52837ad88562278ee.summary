@entity1 , @entity2 ( @entity3 ) the children laugh and shriek , as some of them seem to always have the capacity to do no matter how depressing the circumstances . their bright clothes provide splashes of color against the otherwise drab monotone white of the endless rows of tents . a small group plays with rocks , replacements for the toys they left behind when they fled , while others clamber through a jagged tear in the wire fence surrounding the refugee camp . the @entity24 refugee camp opened around six months ago , made up of some 4,000 tents and counting . thousands of @entity33 now call this corner of @entity2 @entity2 home , about 18 miles ( 30 kilometers ) from one of the front lines with @entity28 , where one can hear the occasional reverberation in the distance of what we are told are airstrikes . the vast majority of the camp 's occupants are from the town of @entity41 , which is near the border with @entity43 , and fled the @entity28 assault there back in august . but not everyone escaped . @entity28 took thousands of @entity33 captive . the fighters separated the young women and girls , some as young as 8 years old , to be sold as slaves , for their " masters " to use as concubines . men faced a choice : convert to @entity54 or be shot . @entity58 was out running errands when @entity28 fighters arrived , taking his wife , @entity61 , their three children -- the youngest of which was just a month old -- and his elderly parents . " they took our phones , jewelry , money , " @entity61 recalls . " they had guns . they forced us at gunpoint into big trailer trucks . " they were taken to a school turned prison in @entity75 . from there , the family was moved from village to village -- and at one stage taken to @entity81 . " they wrote everyone 's name down and they asked where we want to work , in the fields , as cleaners or as herders , " she says . @entity61 and her family chose to herd goats . they were then taken to a @entity95 village whose residents had fled , where they were part of a group of around 40 living in one house . in the home , @entity61 found a cell phone left behind by its former occupants and called her husband . " i said we are alive but we are prisoners . " @entity61 's husband , who up until that moment had lost the will to live , thinking his family was dead , says he cried out of happiness despite his pain . @entity61 would call when she could , briefly , after midnight , hiding under her bedcovers . if she was caught with a phone , she would be killed . the village itself was a massive prison , its entrances guarded by @entity28 fighters . she recalls that two men , in their late 40s or 50s , tried to escape . when they were caught , their bones were broken , their bodies tied to the back of a truck and then driven through the streets . the @entity33 captives were forced to watch the gruesome spectacle . the men 's corpses were then tossed into a ditch and an order given not to bury them . one night , some of the @entity33 men risked their lives to toss dirt onto the bodies , to give those slain what dignity they could . @entity61 tells us that about a week before we met , @entity28 fighters came by and took away her in - laws and the other elderly people living in the house . " we did n't know where they were taking them , we thought we would be next , " she remembers . so she and the rest of the group realized that they had to try to flee . " we decided that either we survive or we do n't . " they left at midnight . @entity61 cradled the baby , as her two other children , ages 3 and 4 years old , clutched at her clothes . she prayed the baby would n't cry , that the children could keep walking . they knew the general direction to take , but not the exact route , and they could only hope it was toward freedom . " when the sun started to come up , i thought that 's it , we are going to get caught , " @entity61 says . " and what am i going to do with the kids ? i ca n't carry all three of them and run . " luckily , @entity61 never had to answer that impossible question . the group made it into @entity2 . the couple ca n't put into words their emotions when they were reunited . @entity58 , gently caressing his daughter 's palm , says he could hardly believe that the woman whose stunning eyes and gentle words he had fallen in love with , and their three children , were by his side again . it had been eight agonizing months . but their joy was tainted by fear for @entity58 's parents . a few days after @entity58 and @entity61 were reunited , @entity28 released 217 captives . no one is disclosing exactly why . among them were 60 children , a handful of men and women , and the rest were elderly -- including @entity58 's parents . " we did n't know if they were going to slaughter us or what they were going to do with us , " @entity58 's father says . " they moved us around a lot , and at one stage we stayed in in one place for three days . " but @entity61 's parents are still with @entity28 . @entity205 , a @entity33 member of @entity207 's parliament , speculates that the @entity33 @entity28 released are individuals they were struggling to care for . @entity205 is part of @entity2 prime minister @entity211 's delegation to the @entity212 this week . she will be addressing the @entity214 -- pleading for more international support for @entity207 and more airstrikes to help defeat @entity28 -- and she will address the plight of the @entity33 . " we sometimes say that we wish we had been massacred . this would be better than being kidnapped and raped . we prefer death now over the fate of what is happening to these girls and women , " @entity205 says . " it is now on the government and on the international community to focus on this . how to get these captives back . it 's inconceivable that in the 21st century , something like this is happening as if we were living in the @entity233 . " @entity61 says she was spared because she was breastfeeding and she had young children , which , we 're told , makes her impure and therefore unable to be used as a sex slave . for @entity61 , what she went through was not the hardest part of her ordeal . it 's the moment when the @entity28 fighters began taking away the girls and young women . she 's haunted by their screams , the image of them being dragged away sobbing and screaming .

the village itself was a massive prison , its entrances guarded by @entity28 fighters*****0
