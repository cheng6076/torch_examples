( @entity0 ) can you imagine paying $ 1,000 a month in rent to live in a one - car garage ? @entity4 , a 30 - year - old woman , does n't have to imagine this scenario because it 's her everyday reality . the small and unusual living space is all that this employed , single mother can afford in her high - cost community in @entity9 , @entity10 . @entity4 is n't alone in her struggles . @entity0 recently published a powerful piece called " poor kids of @entity14 " that documents the affordable housing challenges facing families in the @entity18 . one aspect featured a house that is home to 16 people , including 11 children . another chronicles a husband and wife named @entity26 and @entity27 , both of whom have jobs , who are living in a @entity33 homeless shelter with their two kids because they do n't have the money to go anywhere else . although @entity14 has unique characteristics , it is n't the only community confronting these challenges . our entire nation is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis . the agency i lead , the @entity46 @entity45 , recently released a report estimating that 7.7 million low - income households live in substandard housing , spend more than half their incomes on rent or both . these are families who are dedicating $ 1 out of every $ 2 they earn just to keep a roof over their head . and the more they spend on housing , the less they have to invest in their children 's education , build up savings and shop at local businesses . these are outcomes that hurt our nation 's economy and require us to respond with swift and bold action . @entity45 is working with local partners across the country to do just that . first , we 're focusing on preserving the affordable housing that already exists . since the mid- 1970s , we have directed and insured loans for multifamily properties that have resulted in more than 700,000 affordable units . but by 2020 , we 're in danger of losing more than 125,000 because these mortgages are maturing , ending agreements to control rents in these units . so we 've launched a preservation effort with private partners to keep these properties affordable for generations to come . we 're also doing the same with public housing . right now , the nation is losing 10,000 units of public housing every year , mainly because of disrepair , @entity45 created the @entity96 initiative to bring private investment into the fold for the public good . it 's cost neutral for the federal government and making a big impact for communities such as @entity103 , @entity104 , where the local housing authority is making 58 years ' worth of repairs in just 22 months , including new lighting , modern windows and better insulation to help residents stay warm and cut energy costs . @entity96 has allowed local communities to raise more than $ 733 million in new capital to date . that 's why we 're asking @entity116 to give every community the chance to participate by lifting the restrictions on this program . no @entity46 should ever have to wait six decades to have a decent and healthy place to call home . in addition to preservation , @entity45 is also working to create new affordable housing . a @entity127 study revealed that in 2012 , there were 11.5 million extremely low - income households and only 3.3 million affordable units available . it 's clear that we ca n't preserve our way out of this problem . we 've got to grow the supply to meet demand , so @entity45 is taking a multifaceted approach . for example , our @entity137 is leveraging $ 4 in private and other public resources for every $ 1 in @entity137 funds and leading to more than 1 million new and rehabilitated units for rent or sale to lower income families . this is more than just a statistic : it is progress for people , from the families living in the @entity151 development in @entity152 to the seniors living in the @entity154 in @entity155 . to keep this momentum going , we 've asked @entity116 to increase @entity137 funding by 16 % to keep building affordable homes , prosperous partnerships and strong communities across the nation . we are also asking @entity116 to expand our @entity162 , which allows recipients of modest means , the elderly , and people with disabilities to find housing in the private market . this includes restoring 67,000 vouchers that were lost to sequestration . and we 're targeting our resources where they can have a big impact . for instance , @entity45 awarded $ 94 million in targeted homelessness assistance to 274 programs across the @entity18 , including @entity14 , in january . and we continue to work with local partners to encourage private investment . to empower communities , president @entity181 has also requested $ 300 million for new @entity183 to help them increase housing affordability , economic growth and access to jobs . all of this work is making a significant contribution to families and communities from coast - to - coast . our nation 's affordable housing challenges wo n't be solved overnight , and we still need to do more to make sure that more folks are able to prosper . let 's not squander this chance to make real progress for @entity46 families . incredible things can happen when a wide variety of leaders come together for the common good . by leveraging private investment and increasing collaboration with state , local and tribal governments and other traditional housing partners , i know we can build a future where affordable housing is available to all .

( @entity0 ) can you imagine paying $ 1,000 a month in rent to live in a one - car garage ? @entity4 , a 30 - year - old woman , does n't have to imagine this scenario because it 's her everyday reality*****1
the small and unusual living space is all that this employed , single mother can afford in her high - cost community in @entity9 , @entity10*****0
@entity4 is n't alone in her struggles*****0
@entity0 recently published a powerful piece called " poor kids of @entity14 " that documents the affordable housing challenges facing families in the @entity18*****1
one aspect featured a house that is home to 16 people , including 11 children*****0
another chronicles a husband and wife named @entity26 and @entity27 , both of whom have jobs , who are living in a @entity33 homeless shelter with their two kids because they do n't have the money to go anywhere else*****0
although @entity14 has unique characteristics , it is n't the only community confronting these challenges*****0
our entire nation is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis*****1
the agency i lead , the @entity46 @entity45 , recently released a report estimating that 7.7 million low - income households live in substandard housing , spend more than half their incomes on rent or both*****0
these are families who are dedicating $ 1 out of every $ 2 they earn just to keep a roof over their head*****0
and the more they spend on housing , the less they have to invest in their children 's education , build up savings and shop at local businesses*****1
these are outcomes that hurt our nation 's economy and require us to respond with swift and bold action*****1
@entity45 is working with local partners across the country to do just that*****0
first , we 're focusing on preserving the affordable housing that already exists*****1
since the mid- 1970s , we have directed and insured loans for multifamily properties that have resulted in more than 700,000 affordable units*****0
but by 2020 , we 're in danger of losing more than 125,000 because these mortgages are maturing , ending agreements to control rents in these units*****0
so we 've launched a preservation effort with private partners to keep these properties affordable for generations to come*****0
we 're also doing the same with public housing*****0
right now , the nation is losing 10,000 units of public housing every year , mainly because of disrepair , @entity45 created the @entity96 initiative to bring private investment into the fold for the public good*****0
it 's cost neutral for the federal government and making a big impact for communities such as @entity103 , @entity104 , where the local housing authority is making 58 years ' worth of repairs in just 22 months , including new lighting , modern windows and better insulation to help residents stay warm and cut energy costs*****1
@entity96 has allowed local communities to raise more than $ 733 million in new capital to date*****0
that 's why we 're asking @entity116 to give every community the chance to participate by lifting the restrictions on this program*****0
no @entity46 should ever have to wait six decades to have a decent and healthy place to call home*****0
in addition to preservation , @entity45 is also working to create new affordable housing*****1
a @entity127 study revealed that in 2012 , there were 11.5 million extremely low - income households and only 3.3 million affordable units available*****0
it 's clear that we ca n't preserve our way out of this problem*****0
we 've got to grow the supply to meet demand , so @entity45 is taking a multifaceted approach*****0
for example , our @entity137 is leveraging $ 4 in private and other public resources for every $ 1 in @entity137 funds and leading to more than 1 million new and rehabilitated units for rent or sale to lower income families*****0
this is more than just a statistic : it is progress for people , from the families living in the @entity151 development in @entity152 to the seniors living in the @entity154 in @entity155*****0
to keep this momentum going , we 've asked @entity116 to increase @entity137 funding by 16 % to keep building affordable homes , prosperous partnerships and strong communities across the nation*****0
we are also asking @entity116 to expand our @entity162 , which allows recipients of modest means , the elderly , and people with disabilities to find housing in the private market*****0
this includes restoring 67,000 vouchers that were lost to sequestration*****0
and we 're targeting our resources where they can have a big impact*****0
for instance , @entity45 awarded $ 94 million in targeted homelessness assistance to 274 programs across the @entity18 , including @entity14 , in january*****0
and we continue to work with local partners to encourage private investment*****0
to empower communities , president @entity181 has also requested $ 300 million for new @entity183 to help them increase housing affordability , economic growth and access to jobs*****0
all of this work is making a significant contribution to families and communities from coast - to - coast*****0
our nation 's affordable housing challenges wo n't be solved overnight , and we still need to do more to make sure that more folks are able to prosper*****1
let 's not squander this chance to make real progress for @entity46 families*****0
incredible things can happen when a wide variety of leaders come together for the common good*****0
by leveraging private investment and increasing collaboration with state , local and tribal governments and other traditional housing partners , i know we can build a future where affordable housing is available to all .*****1
