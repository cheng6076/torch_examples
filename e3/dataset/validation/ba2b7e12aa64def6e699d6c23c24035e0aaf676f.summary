( @entity2 ) a 24 - year - old man is in custody after he called for an ambulance , only to have @entity6 authorities come and discover weapons , ammunition and evidence of his plans to target churches -- an attack that someone in @entity14 requested , a top prosecutor said wednesday . the man was identified later as @entity17 , @entity6 interior minister @entity15 told television broadcaster @entity19 . @entity21 prosecutor @entity20 said @entity17 asked for medical help at his home in @entity21 ' 13th district sunday morning , claiming he had accidentally injured himself when he mishandled a weapon . but authorities found more than a man with a gunshot wound in his thigh . @entity20 said @entity17 was someone suspected of killing a 32 - year - old woman hours earlier and who then intended to launch a larger - scale terror attack in the near future . " ( @entity35 ) let them believe that he was the victim , " @entity6 president @entity34 said wednesday . " but police understood that there was an investigation that needed to be initiated . " that probe started in earnest when police spotted traces of blood and bags in the suspect 's car . based on this discovery " and in view of the attitude and suspicious behavior of the individual , " they looked inside the car and found a loaded @entity56 gun , a 9 - mm revolver , three cell phones , a laptop , a usb key , a satellite navigation system " and handwritten documents that contained information on possible targets , " @entity20 said . a search inside his home turned up yet more potentially key evidence , including three more kalashnikovs , three bulletproof vests , police armbands , a camera , some 2,000 euros in cash and " documents in @entity75 mentioning @entity76 and @entity77 , " according to the prosecutor . " a terrorist attack has been foiled , " @entity34 said . " it 's not the first time .
