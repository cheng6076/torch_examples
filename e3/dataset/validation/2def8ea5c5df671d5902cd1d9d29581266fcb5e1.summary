@entity1 ( @entity2 ) a destination for the destitute , @entity0 is the " promised land " for thousands of migrants and refugees making the desperate journey from @entity8 to @entity11 's @entity10 coast*****1
more than 10,000 people have arrived from @entity13 since last weekend alone , according to the @entity15 @entity14*****0
stories of death at sea and unimaginable suffering are nothing new in the waters between @entity8 and @entity15 ; boat people have been arriving on @entity15 's islands for more than a decade*****0
but what makes the current influx different is the increase in numbers and the absence of control from the ports of embarkation , specifically those in @entity13 , because when @entity32 was in control , he also controlled the flow of migrant ships*****0
in 2008 , the - then @entity15 prime minister @entity36 and @entity32 signed an historic friendship agreement in which @entity15 promised to invest $ 5 billion in @entity13 infrastructure and @entity32 promised to close what he described as a " spigot " of migrants*****0
during a three - day state visit to @entity15 in august 2010 , he famously threatened to " turn @entity11 black " if @entity13 did not enjoy cordial relations with the @entity45*****0
after the agreement , @entity32 kept his promise and the number of arrivals drastically decreased*****0
for a time , almost all migrant arrivals came from @entity51 , just 70 miles from the @entity15 island of @entity53*****0
because @entity15 sent most of those migrants who did not qualify for political asylum back to @entity51 , the flow eventually tapered off*****0
and once a new @entity51 government was in place , after the @entity59 , @entity15 signed an accord with @entity51 in which they promised to help patrol @entity51 's ports*****0
but after @entity32 was overthrown , the flow of migrants from @entity13 exploded again : the @entity64 ( @entity64 ) in @entity1 told @entity2 that more than 140,000 migrants arrived from the @entity8 coast in 2011*****0
in october 2013 , after a tragic boat accident off the coast of @entity53 in which 349 people -- including an infant still attached to its mother by the umbilical cord -- died , trapped like sardines in their smugglers ' boat as it sank , @entity15 decided it had to act*****1
in november of 2013 , the @entity78 launched a € 9m - a - month search - and - rescue program called @entity80 , in which @entity15 naval ships patrolled the seas to rescue migrants*****0
in just one year , the program rescued more than 160,000 migrants , according to the @entity78*****1
due to budget constraints and criticism from the @entity45 that the program itself was encouraging migrants to head across the @entity10 , the mission ended in october 2014*****1
by the end of the year , more than 174,000 people had been rescued in @entity15 ; an estimated 3,072 people died making the journey , according to the @entity64*****1
in november last year , the @entity45 's border control , @entity97 , started its own mission -- @entity99 -- with a budget of less than a third that of @entity80*****0
@entity97 has no vessels or surveillance equipment of its own , so has to rely on @entity11 member states to lend them ships ; a ship from @entity109 , at the far north of the continent , is currently involved in @entity97 's operations off southern @entity11*****0
when @entity15 ended @entity80 , the @entity111 high commissioner for refugees @entity112 warned that some @entity11 governments were making " keeping foreigners out a higher priority than upholding asylum standards*****0
" " this is a mistake , and precisely the wrong reaction for an era in which record numbers of people are fleeing wars , " @entity112 told a @entity119 policy meeting*****0
" @entity125 are concerns for any country , but policies must be designed in a way that human lives do not end up becoming collateral damage*****0
" once migrants arrive in @entity15 , they are supposed to be processed for political asylum and monitored until it is granted or denied , but @entity15 has been sanctioned by the @entity45 for not fingerprinting new arrivals*****0
by law , @entity15 has to take care of the arrivals , but many have no intention of staying in the country , and few of the reception centers are gated , meaning migrants can come and go as they please*****0
and with no physical border controls between @entity15 and other @entity11 countries , they can then disperse across the continent*****0
@entity148 , 27 , an it specialist who worked for six years in @entity149 , arrived in @entity0 in december on board a smuggler 's boat*****0
he told @entity2 he was never fingerprinted in @entity15 , and eventually made it to @entity154 where he is studying to learn the language and find work*****0
he says the human trafficking network is a finely - oiled machine that fills a growing need*****0
" i would have done anything to get here , " @entity148 said*****0
" it was worth the risk , the bad treatment and the fear*****0
hard as that may be to believe , it is a better life*****0
