" this case is a gray area of law because it 's new , " @entity201 said . " it 's developing as we speak , " he said . " it 's a question , i think , of whether to decide if these frozen ( embryos ) are human beings or whether they are property . since they are unborn , some states in the @entity230 look at these ( embryos ) not as life , but as property . " @entity201 said the lawsuit reportedly filed by @entity16 will now open new issues , and a @entity202 court will have to decide to whom the embryos belong . " these embryos are not inside her body , " he said . " they are in a nitrogen tank in a clinic in @entity63 , so there the @entity245 of @entity246 vs. @entity248 case can not be used by the @entity5 team to allege that the ( embryos ) would present some danger to her health as they did in that case . " in that case , the @entity230 @entity255 declared a statute that requires parental and spousal consent for abortions to be unconstitutional . the lawsuit comes as @entity5 promotes her new movie , " @entity262 , " with co-star @entity263 . @entity5 is now reportedly engaged to actor @entity264 . @entity1 's @entity265 and @entity266 contributed to this report .
