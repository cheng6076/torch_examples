@entity6 , @entity2 ( @entity7 ) before " @entity5 " duo , @entity0 and @entity1 , the last @entity2 executed for drug offenses abroad was @entity8 by @entity9 in 2005 . although @entity6 then , as it is now , was strongly opposed to the death penalty , @entity8 's death did not harm @entity2 's relationship with @entity9 , nor the @entity2 people 's view of that country . the executions of @entity0 and @entity1 early wednesday morning will be a different story . their deaths will result in short to medium term frictions between @entity6 and @entity21 at the highest levels . however , this will soon ease as the two countries have a number of common interests that neither side can abandon . but the @entity2 public 's view of @entity30 , and anger with its government , will take much longer to subside . those sympathetic to the dilemma faced by @entity30 's president @entity35 will argue that he was politically bound to allow the executions to take place . he ran on a robust anti-drug campaign , arguing that 18,000 @entity30 die from illicit drugs each year , though those figures are widely disputed . as the saga over whether the executions would take place dragged on for months , following ever more desperate legal challenges from the defense teams , @entity35 painted himself into a corner . the widespread @entity2 perception is that the president owed his power to @entity51 and former president @entity52 . believed by many to be the most powerful person in the country , some suggest that @entity52 insisted @entity35 stand by his hard - line anti-drugs policy and stare down @entity2 pressure -- or lose her support and reputation as a firm leader in the process . as recently as last year , it seemed that @entity2 prime minister @entity64 empathized with the underlying pressures and back - room obligations on leaders . while working assiduously behind the scenes to argue for clemency for the " @entity5 " duo , @entity64 nevertheless appeared to accept the inevitability of the executions , even as he publicly reiterated @entity2 's opposition to capital punishment . such a softly — softly approach was also aided by an @entity2 public that did not seem overly interested in the plight of @entity0 and @entity1 . all that changed when credible stories began to emerge about the rehabilitation of the two @entity2 prisoners : @entity0 becoming a pastor and respected religious example for his fellow prisoners and @entity1 a passionate painter with impressive talent . such was the regard held for the @entity2 duo that even the governor of the @entity92 jail where they were kept , @entity94 , urged a reconsideration of their impending executions . as the duo attracted greater public sympathy -- including from a joint statement by the last six prime ministers urging @entity21 to reconsider -- the good , great and popular in @entity2 society also united behind the plea for mercy . under increasing pressure in the polls , the @entity64 government began to publicly pursue what it had been doing in private : urging a stay of execution on legal and moral grounds -- even once reminding @entity21 of the over $ 1 billion worth of aid that @entity30 has received from @entity2 over the past decade . @entity2 have a dim view of how @entity30 has responded . while @entity21 and many @entity30 people viewed this as typical posturing and moral grandstanding from a developed @entity120 neighbor , @entity2 began to once again see @entity30 in an unattractive light -- when it was so recently upheld as the shining example of a rising democracy in @entity124 . the hard - line stance of @entity35 was seen as the heartless and self - interested actions of a weak and inexperienced president attempting to establish his authority -- at the expense of rehabilitated @entity2 lives . credible accusations by the defense attorney for the two @entity2 that a lighter sentence was denied to them because of their incapacity to pay the bribe demanded of them from the sentencing judges affirmed perceptions of @entity30 's judicial system as corrupt if not incompetent . particularly galling for the @entity140 government and @entity2 was @entity35 's refusal to even accept a phone call from @entity64 to discuss the issue , and the wall of silence and non-engagement that confronted @entity2 ministers attempting to plead the case with @entity30 counterparts . perhaps the final straw was @entity30 's decision to deploy hundreds of commandos and four naval ships to transport the handcuffed prisoners from @entity155 to their island for execution -- viewed in @entity2 as a deliberate backhander by @entity21 to @entity6 . the @entity64 government had warned of unspecified consequences should the executions take place , and on wednesday morning announced the unprecedented recall of @entity2 's ambassador to @entity30 . there are unlikely to be any ministerial visits between the two countries for many months , if not the rest of the year . while @entity2 is not likely to withdraw aid to @entity30 , @entity6 will also ensure that it offers @entity21 no special favors in the immediate future . given the degree of ongoing cooperation on important issues , such as terrorism , money laundering and drug trafficking , @entity2 and @entity30 will continue to work together behind the scenes at the operational levels . @entity2 will also need ongoing @entity30 cooperation to stem the flow of illegal boat arrivals to @entity2 shores and will not want to jeopardize what has already been achieved . for these reasons , the fallout between capitals will be contained . but while the @entity30 public appears divided as to whether their government acted wisely , the @entity2 public is united that @entity21 did not . this means that for them , and even as a democracy , the older images of @entity30 as a corrupt , immature and unpredictable neighbor will return . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author .

@entity6 , @entity2 ( @entity7 ) before " @entity5 " duo , @entity0 and @entity1 , the last @entity2 executed for drug offenses abroad was @entity8 by @entity9 in 2005*****1
although @entity6 then , as it is now , was strongly opposed to the death penalty , @entity8 's death did not harm @entity2 's relationship with @entity9 , nor the @entity2 people 's view of that country*****0
the executions of @entity0 and @entity1 early wednesday morning will be a different story*****0
their deaths will result in short to medium term frictions between @entity6 and @entity21 at the highest levels*****0
however , this will soon ease as the two countries have a number of common interests that neither side can abandon*****0
but the @entity2 public 's view of @entity30 , and anger with its government , will take much longer to subside*****1
those sympathetic to the dilemma faced by @entity30 's president @entity35 will argue that he was politically bound to allow the executions to take place*****0
he ran on a robust anti-drug campaign , arguing that 18,000 @entity30 die from illicit drugs each year , though those figures are widely disputed*****0
as the saga over whether the executions would take place dragged on for months , following ever more desperate legal challenges from the defense teams , @entity35 painted himself into a corner*****0
the widespread @entity2 perception is that the president owed his power to @entity51 and former president @entity52*****0
believed by many to be the most powerful person in the country , some suggest that @entity52 insisted @entity35 stand by his hard - line anti-drugs policy and stare down @entity2 pressure -- or lose her support and reputation as a firm leader in the process*****0
as recently as last year , it seemed that @entity2 prime minister @entity64 empathized with the underlying pressures and back - room obligations on leaders*****0
while working assiduously behind the scenes to argue for clemency for the " @entity5 " duo , @entity64 nevertheless appeared to accept the inevitability of the executions , even as he publicly reiterated @entity2 's opposition to capital punishment*****1
such a softly — softly approach was also aided by an @entity2 public that did not seem overly interested in the plight of @entity0 and @entity1*****1
all that changed when credible stories began to emerge about the rehabilitation of the two @entity2 prisoners : @entity0 becoming a pastor and respected religious example for his fellow prisoners and @entity1 a passionate painter with impressive talent*****1
such was the regard held for the @entity2 duo that even the governor of the @entity92 jail where they were kept , @entity94 , urged a reconsideration of their impending executions*****0
as the duo attracted greater public sympathy -- including from a joint statement by the last six prime ministers urging @entity21 to reconsider -- the good , great and popular in @entity2 society also united behind the plea for mercy*****1
under increasing pressure in the polls , the @entity64 government began to publicly pursue what it had been doing in private : urging a stay of execution on legal and moral grounds -- even once reminding @entity21 of the over $ 1 billion worth of aid that @entity30 has received from @entity2 over the past decade*****1
@entity2 have a dim view of how @entity30 has responded*****1
while @entity21 and many @entity30 people viewed this as typical posturing and moral grandstanding from a developed @entity120 neighbor , @entity2 began to once again see @entity30 in an unattractive light -- when it was so recently upheld as the shining example of a rising democracy in @entity124*****1
the hard - line stance of @entity35 was seen as the heartless and self - interested actions of a weak and inexperienced president attempting to establish his authority -- at the expense of rehabilitated @entity2 lives*****0
credible accusations by the defense attorney for the two @entity2 that a lighter sentence was denied to them because of their incapacity to pay the bribe demanded of them from the sentencing judges affirmed perceptions of @entity30 's judicial system as corrupt if not incompetent*****1
particularly galling for the @entity140 government and @entity2 was @entity35 's refusal to even accept a phone call from @entity64 to discuss the issue , and the wall of silence and non-engagement that confronted @entity2 ministers attempting to plead the case with @entity30 counterparts*****1
perhaps the final straw was @entity30 's decision to deploy hundreds of commandos and four naval ships to transport the handcuffed prisoners from @entity155 to their island for execution -- viewed in @entity2 as a deliberate backhander by @entity21 to @entity6*****1
the @entity64 government had warned of unspecified consequences should the executions take place , and on wednesday morning announced the unprecedented recall of @entity2 's ambassador to @entity30*****1
there are unlikely to be any ministerial visits between the two countries for many months , if not the rest of the year*****0
while @entity2 is not likely to withdraw aid to @entity30 , @entity6 will also ensure that it offers @entity21 no special favors in the immediate future*****1
given the degree of ongoing cooperation on important issues , such as terrorism , money laundering and drug trafficking , @entity2 and @entity30 will continue to work together behind the scenes at the operational levels*****1
@entity2 will also need ongoing @entity30 cooperation to stem the flow of illegal boat arrivals to @entity2 shores and will not want to jeopardize what has already been achieved*****1
for these reasons , the fallout between capitals will be contained*****0
but while the @entity30 public appears divided as to whether their government acted wisely , the @entity2 public is united that @entity21 did not*****1
this means that for them , and even as a democracy , the older images of @entity30 as a corrupt , immature and unpredictable neighbor will return*****0
