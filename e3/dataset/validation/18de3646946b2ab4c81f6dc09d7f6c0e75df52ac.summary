( @entity2 ) the shootings ' main similarity is that the officer was white and the victim was black and unarmed . outside of that , the highly publicized police shootings in @entity6 and @entity7 bear only mild resemblance . so what 's changed between the shooting death of @entity12 in @entity6 , @entity13 , in august , and that of @entity15 in @entity7 , @entity16 , last weekend ? and did the backlash and publicity of the @entity6 shooting influence the handling of the @entity7 incident ? it 's tough to say for sure , but here are some of the stark differences in the cases , the lessons learned by both police and the public , and concrete changes that could help mend tensions in the future . @entity6 : officer @entity33 said he shot @entity12 after the two struggled over @entity33 's gun , and witnesses to the shooting had different accounts -- often conflicting -- of where @entity33 was , where @entity12 was and whether @entity12 was surrendering or charging the officer . @entity7 : though it 's unclear what happened in the moments before a bystander began recording the incident on his phone , it 's 100 % clear from the video that @entity15 was not posing a threat to officer @entity51 when the policeman opened fire on @entity15 as he ran away . takeaway : where @entity12 's killing was a breeding ground for speculation -- with a stark divide between those who said @entity33 was justified and those who said @entity12 was senselessly slain -- no such debate has emerged in the @entity15 shooting . it would be tough to extrapolate for certain , but it 's possible that the clear - cut imagery of an officer shooting a fleeing man in the back resulted in the prompt charges against the officer , and that quick reaction by authorities in @entity16 after the video surfaced headed off the sort of violence that repeatedly unfolded in @entity6 as the process of determining @entity33 's fate dragged on for months . @entity6 : black residents outnumber whites in the @entity82 suburb by more than a 2 - to - 1 ratio , yet at the time of @entity12 's shooting , there were only three black officers on the city 's 53 - member force , and there was only one @entity94 - @entity93 member of the six - member @entity95 .

( @entity2 ) the shootings ' main similarity is that the officer was white and the victim was black and unarmed*****0
outside of that , the highly publicized police shootings in @entity6 and @entity7 bear only mild resemblance*****1
so what 's changed between the shooting death of @entity12 in @entity6 , @entity13 , in august , and that of @entity15 in @entity7 , @entity16 , last weekend ? and did the backlash and publicity of the @entity6 shooting influence the handling of the @entity7 incident ? it 's tough to say for sure , but here are some of the stark differences in the cases , the lessons learned by both police and the public , and concrete changes that could help mend tensions in the future*****1
@entity6 : officer @entity33 said he shot @entity12 after the two struggled over @entity33 's gun , and witnesses to the shooting had different accounts -- often conflicting -- of where @entity33 was , where @entity12 was and whether @entity12 was surrendering or charging the officer*****1
@entity7 : though it 's unclear what happened in the moments before a bystander began recording the incident on his phone , it 's 100 % clear from the video that @entity15 was not posing a threat to officer @entity51 when the policeman opened fire on @entity15 as he ran away*****1
takeaway : where @entity12 's killing was a breeding ground for speculation -- with a stark divide between those who said @entity33 was justified and those who said @entity12 was senselessly slain -- no such debate has emerged in the @entity15 shooting*****1
it would be tough to extrapolate for certain , but it 's possible that the clear - cut imagery of an officer shooting a fleeing man in the back resulted in the prompt charges against the officer , and that quick reaction by authorities in @entity16 after the video surfaced headed off the sort of violence that repeatedly unfolded in @entity6 as the process of determining @entity33 's fate dragged on for months*****1
@entity6 : black residents outnumber whites in the @entity82 suburb by more than a 2 - to - 1 ratio , yet at the time of @entity12 's shooting , there were only three black officers on the city 's 53 - member force , and there was only one @entity94 - @entity93 member of the six - member @entity95*****1
( two more african - americans were voted in during this week 's city 's elections*****0
) @entity7 : it 's closer to an even split here , with census data from 2010 showing the city is 47 % black and 42 % white*****1
the makeup of the city 's police department is unclear , though it 's been widely reported that 2007 federal figures indicated it was about 80 % black*****1
three of the 10 city council members are black*****0
takeaway : the ratio of white and black officers on the @entity114 appears to more closely mirror the makeup of its population than does the @entity117 , but both are considerably off*****0
as for the city councils , the latest election in @entity6 makes its governing body more representative than @entity7 's*****1
but before you place too much emphasis on the percentages , there are other variables to consider , like policing methods , as @entity2 political commentator @entity129 pointed out*****0
changing the racial makeup of a department alone wo n't do the trick if officers are n't taught the best practices*****0
" black people did n't march and fight and struggle to have black officers kill us and black officers beat us and black officers harass us , " he said*****0
" i want police officers who are capable of doing the job properly*****1
we need community - based policing if we 're going to believe that police are the proper force to be in our neighborhoods*****0
" @entity6 : there was no bystander video of @entity12 's death -- no concrete evidence to support or refute different witness claims about what had transpired*****1
@entity7 : it 's unlikely @entity51 would have been fired and charged with murder so quickly if not for video shot by witness @entity157*****1
even @entity7 's police chief said he was disgusted by the footage of @entity15 's shooting*****1
not only does the video show @entity51 firing eight shots at @entity15 as he 's running away , it also shows him placing a dark - colored object next to @entity15 's lifeless body*****1
that could be significant , because @entity51 initially said @entity15 had taken his taser and he feared for his life*****0
but if investigators determine the object dropped next to @entity15 's body was actually the @entity167 , @entity51 could be accused of planting evidence*****1
the takeaway : @entity6 resident @entity173 said what happened in her city helped people across the country to feel empowered to stand up for themselves*****0
the video of the @entity7 shooting , she said , is vital*****0
" if there is no video , folks do n't believe it because it sounds so asinine that something like this would ever happen in this country , " she said*****0
" but with a video , you ca n't say it 's not happening*****0
" @entity6 : the largely peaceful protests in @entity6 were marred by looting , arson and even shootings*****0
@entity194 erupted again in november after @entity33 , the officer who shot @entity12 , was n't indicted*****0
and even after @entity6 's police chief resigned last month , two officers were shot during a protest at the @entity117*****1
@entity7 : after @entity15 was killed in @entity16 over the weekend , protests in @entity7 have been peaceful so far*****1
the takeaway : some @entity6 residents say what happened in their city is playing a role in the way @entity7 is handling its own tragedy*****1
@entity206 , who recently made an unsuccessful bid for a @entity209 seat , said he was glad to see authorities in @entity16 charge @entity51 with murder*****0
" i am hopeful that their motives are right and not just based on the fact that they are trying to avoid the same types of issues that came down in @entity6 , " @entity206 said*****0
@entity6 : it took @entity6 police six days to publicly identify @entity33 as the officer who shot @entity12 , and in the immediate aftermath of the shooting , then - police chief @entity222 decided not to visit @entity12 's family*****1
and rather than charge @entity33 and let a grand jury decide whether the charges had merit -- as many civil rights advocates wanted -- the prosecutor in the case instead made the unorthodox choice of presenting both sides himself and letting the grand jury decide whether to charge the officer*****0
@entity7 : @entity51 was identified by authorities and charged with murder on tuesday , two days after @entity157 shared his video with @entity15 's family*****1
mayor @entity241 denounced the shooting and said @entity51 made a " bad decision*****0
" both @entity241 and the police chief also visited @entity15 's family*****1
" when you 're wrong , you 're wrong , " he said*****0
" and if you make a bad decision -- do n't care if you 're behind the shield or just a citizen on the street -- you have to live by that decision*****0
" the takeaway : former @entity6 mayor @entity252 said the city has influenced others*****1
" i think these situations are given much more scrutiny now , " said @entity252 , who won a seat on @entity6 's city council this week*****1
" they have seen what has happened here in @entity6*****0
every mayor and city council is very cautious in what they say and what they do*****0
" @entity6 : after @entity12 's death in august , many asked why @entity33 did n't have a body camera*****1
the shooting spurred a nationwide debate over whether officers should wear cameras on their lapels*****1
three months later , president @entity276 pledged $ 263 million to procure body cameras and training for up to 50,000 police officers*****1
@entity7 : @entity51 also was not wearing a body camera when he killed @entity15*****1
but after the shooting , the mayor said the city was ordering an additional 150 body cameras " so every officer on the street " in the city will have one*****1
that 's in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered , @entity241 said*****1
the takeaway : not everyone agrees that all officers should wear body cameras*****1
some police unions have scoffed at the idea , and the @entity298 has cited privacy concerns*****0
they 're also expensive*****0
several camera models cost at least $ 500 each , and storing all that footage can cost as much as $ 20,000 a year*****0
but @entity304 president @entity303 said more body cameras will help protect not just the public , but also police*****1
" i think if officers know that their actions are being recorded on a consistent basis , it 's going to protect good officers who do the right thing , " @entity303 said*****1
" but it 's also going to ferret out , if you will , bad actions by bad officers*****1
