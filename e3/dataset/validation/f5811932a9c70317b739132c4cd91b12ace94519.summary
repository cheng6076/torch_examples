( @entity0 ) the nation 's top stories will be unfolding tuesday in courthouses and political arenas across the country*****0
@entity6 is hosting two of the highest - profile court trials in recent memory -- those of former @entity12 @entity11 and @entity14 bombing suspect @entity13*****1
both lengthy trials are coming to a close*****1
in @entity18 , @entity19 , sen. @entity17 made the not - so - surprising announcement that he will run for president , while in @entity23 , voters will head to the polls in a very surprising runoff between mayor @entity26 and challenger @entity27*****1
and in @entity28 , @entity29 , the shadow of @entity31 and the protests over his shooting by officer @entity34 will loom large over the city 's elections*****1
here 's a breakdown of what to expect today and how we got here : @entity13 , who 's accused of detonating a bomb at the 2013 @entity42 along with his now - deceased brother , faces the stiffest of penalties -- life in prison or the death penalty -- if he 's found guilty on any of 17 capital counts against him , including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism*****0
the 13th juror : what defense ? on monday , survivors and victims ' families wept and @entity13 fidgeted at a defense table as jurors heard a prosecutor allege that the 21 - year - old " brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets*****0
" the jury on tuesday morning began what is expected to be a lengthy deliberation process on 30 total charges , before the so - called penalty phase , should he be found guilty on any counts*****0
it took prosecutors months to present 131 witnesses to support their claim that @entity11 killed semi-pro player @entity79 , yet on monday , @entity11 's defense team wrapped up its witnesses in less than a day*****0
closing arguments are scheduled for tuesday , and the jury will begin deliberations soon thereafter*****0
jurors in @entity84 , @entity6 , will be asked to decide if @entity11 is culpable in the shooting death of @entity79 , whose body was found in a @entity6 industrial park in the summer of 2013*****0
much of the evidence against @entity11 is circumstantial , and among the facts the jury will be asked to take into consideration are @entity12 owner @entity92 's testimony , the testimony of @entity11 's fiancee , some grainy footage from @entity11 's home security system and a footprint left by a @entity99 shoe*****0
@entity11 known for swagger , even in court ok , sure , no one was floored when the @entity19 senator announced his bid for the @entity105 , but of course it was news when he made it official tuesday*****1
@entity17 is expected to hit the campaign trail visiting the all - important early voters in @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115*****0
the physician rode a wave of tea party popularity into the @entity120 in 2010 , where he carefully built a brand of mainstream libertarianism , and he is banking on a coalition of younger voters and traditional @entity126 to usher him into the @entity128*****0
@entity17 and sen. @entity129 are the only declared candidates for the @entity126 nomination , though the field will certainly grow and could include the likes of @entity135 's @entity134 , @entity137 's @entity136 , @entity139 's @entity138 , @entity113 's @entity140 and @entity135 's @entity141*****0
would @entity17 be here without @entity143 ? it 's the @entity23 's first runoff for a citywide office , and it 's being billed as a battle for the " future of @entity23*****0
" in one corner , you have @entity26 , president @entity150 's notoriously hard - charging former chief of staff , and in the other , you have @entity27 , a county commissioner who has come to embody populist and liberal @entity153 ' frustrations with the @entity23 incumbent*****0
after @entity26 failed to snare half the vote in february 's general election , he will go head - to - head with @entity27*****0
the timing is interesting , too , as @entity159 , @entity160 and spring break appear to have spurred more than 142,000 early votes , up from about 90,000 before the first round of voting in february*****0
following @entity31 's death , the national spotlight shone on @entity28 , particularly how the city 's predominantly black population is woefully underrepresented in its police force and @entity170*****0
yet with all the hubbub about the face of civic leadership , only four in 10 city residents hit the polls in november to cast ballots*****0
residents speak out ahead of vote tuesday 's election will bring change , no matter how the ballots are cast : two black men are running for one of the open seats , and the current lone black council member is n't up for re-election*****0
in another ward , two black women and two white men are vying for an open seat*****0
and a white protester is running for a third post .*****0
