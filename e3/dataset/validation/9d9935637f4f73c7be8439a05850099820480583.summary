( @entity0 ) let 's start with a pop quiz ( space junkies can skip this test )*****0
true or @entity6 , @entity5 is : 1 ) the planet closest to the sun in our solar system 2 ) so hot that water could n't possibly exist there 3 ) something used in old - style glass thermometers 4 ) a planet you do n't think about very often answers : true , @entity6 , @entity18 ( but not what we 're talking about in this story ) and i 'm guessing no. 4 is true too*****0
if you flunked the test , it might be because @entity5 ( the planet ) suffers from bad ( or very little ) press*****0
or , maybe it 's just bad lighting*****0
@entity5 orbits about 35,983,125 miles from the sun. compare that to @entity32 -- we 're about 93 million miles from the sun. @entity5 's closeness to the sun makes it hard to see except at dawn and twilight*****0
this may be one reason we do n't think about it much*****0
@entity44 , on the other hand , the planet between @entity32 and @entity5 , appears to be the brightest planet in the sky*****0
it 's so bright it 's been mistaken for an airplane*****0
pilot sends plane into dive after mistaking @entity44 for oncoming plane but back to @entity5*****0
it 's getting some attention from the media now because it 's about to get a visitor*****0
the @entity59 ( an acronym for @entity61 ) is about to crash onto @entity5*****1
the probe was launched in 2004 and traveled more than six and a half years before it started orbiting @entity5 on march 18 , 2011*****1
now , @entity59 is running out of fuel and @entity59 says it will hit the planet 's surface at 8,750 mph ( 3.91 kilometers per second ) around april 30*****0
you wo n't be able to see it hit because @entity61 will crash on the side of @entity5 facing away from @entity32*****1
there 's no way to save the spacecraft , but mission operators at the @entity74 ( @entity74 ) in @entity75 , @entity76 , have been doing what they can to delay the inevitable*****0
they 've been using the little bit of fuel left on board to maneuver the spacecraft to keep it in orbit*****0
they 'll do one final maneuver on friday , april 24*****0
" following this last maneuver , we will finally declare the spacecraft out of propellant , as this maneuver will deplete nearly all of our remaining helium gas , " mission systems engineer @entity86 said at a recent media briefing*****0
" at that point , the spacecraft will no longer be capable of fighting the downward push of the sun 's gravity*****0
" but rather than mourn the loss , scientists held a briefing to celebrate the mission 's success*****0
" for the first time in history we now have real knowledge about the planet @entity5 that shows it to be a fascinating world as part of our diverse solar system , " said @entity106 , associate administrator for the @entity107 at @entity108 in @entity109*****0
one of @entity59 's big findings : it sent back data indicating that ice in @entity5 's shadowed polar regions , if spread over an area the size of @entity109 , would be more than two miles thick , @entity59 said*****1
it also took some amazing photos of the planet*****0
so the @entity59 mission is ending , but scientists say they 'll be busy for years studying data from the probe*****1
and if you want to see @entity5 with your own eyes , you may be in luck if you can find an area with dark skies*****0
it will be visible in the night sky just before dusk until about the end of may*****0
your favorite astronomy website will have some helpful guides*****0
