( @entity1 ) please , not even a demonstration . @entity3 's family had asked there be quiet on @entity6 's streets the day they laid him to rest . and above all , no violence . raging hordes turned a deaf ear to that on monday . but a handful of people repeated the family 's message . they became criers in the desert against countless young people flinging rocks at police , breaking windows , looting and setting fires . the peacemakers -- clergy , @entity3 's family and brave residents -- placed themselves in the rioters ' way . their message was the same . " i want them all to go back home , " said rev. @entity32 . " it 's disrespect to the family . the family was very clear -- we 've been saying it all along -- today there was absolutely no protest , no demonstration , " he said . but the messengers were a finger in a dam that quickly crumbled , as rowdy groups swelled into a full urban riot . it overshadowed the message peaceful protesters delivered on prior days -- justice for @entity3 . the 25 - year - old @entity54 - @entity53 man died from spinal injuries after being arrested earlier this month . the early fits of violence came in the afternoon , about the time mourners left @entity3 's memorial services blocks away , rev. @entity32 said . they bumped right into it . " for us to come out of the burial and walk into this is absolutely inexcusable , " he said . he did not want to see it spread to downtown @entity6 , where some rioters said it would , and organized people to stand in the way . " we have a line of gentlemen from the @entity72 to build a human wall , as well as men from the @entity75 making that human wall , " he said . but as crowds turned into multitudes , the intervention became a drop in the bucket by compare , and police lines were also no match . as officers in riot gear receded , flames engulfed cars and stores and roared out of apartment buildings into the night sky . a senior living facility under construction by a baptist church burned to the ground . the blazes stretched the fire departments ' resources , as at least 30 trucks deployed . looters streamed into a @entity100 , bodegas and liquor stores and walked out with what they could carry . a young man in a blue sweatshirt tried to talk people down by himself . he walked up to @entity1 correspondent @entity107 , as a store nearby was being looted . it later went up in flames . the man , who did n't say his name , was disgusted at what was happening in his neighborhood and disappointed in the police response to rioting . there was a line of police down the street , not far away . " they could have moved down here to stop it , " he told @entity107 . the @entity3 family 's lawyers , again , put the family 's wish out to the public that there be no protests that day , let alone violence . it 's marring the cause and hope for change that may have come out of the investigation into @entity3 's death , said family attorney @entity139 . " that 's just disintegrated into just looking at @entity6 and thinking that the city is the city of violence , " she said . against all odds , a handful of individuals kept trying to stop it . a tall , adult man walked up to a young man who was confronting riot police . he slung an arm over his shoulder , turned him back around in the other direction and marched him away from police lines . but as they strolled past a crowd , a young man behind them hurled a stone at police , putting his whole body into the throw . at least one young man paid the price for his participation , when his mother turned up to spank him home . before running cameras , she slapped him in the head again and again , driving him away from the crowd , as she cursed . police commissioner @entity170 later thanked her . " i wish i had more parents that took charge of their kids out there tonight , " he said . after night fell , giving way to a 10 p.m. curfew for juveniles , @entity176 stood alone with his back to a line of police in riot gear . he shooed away young people tempted to approach them . " go ! step your -- ss away !

" the guys who pulled me aside are self - identifying as @entity199 and say they do n't approve of whats happening . ' this is our community , ' " wrote @entity211 reporter @entity210 on his confirmed @entity213 account . gangs members joined community leaders and @entity3 's family for a press conference monday night on the stage at @entity221 , which had held @entity3 's funeral . an announcer thanked them for coming to the church . the gangs have signed a peace deal and are uniting to push against police lines in protests , according to a report by the @entity230 . rev. @entity32 also mentioned their peace treaty . but police say the gangs ' purpose goes much further -- that they and another gang called the @entity239 plan to ' take out ' law enforcement officers , police said .

" to see that it turned into all this violence and destruction , i am appalled , " said @entity250 , @entity3 's stepfather . " i want y'all to get justice for my son , but do n't do it like this here , " said @entity3 's mother @entity254 , who wore a t - shirt with her son 's photo . " i do n't think that 's for @entity3 , " his twin sister @entity263 said . " i think the violence is wrong . " after their comments , @entity3 family lawyer @entity266 took the microphone . violence is not the path to change , he said . then he got back to the message than had been bitterly marred by the rioting . @entity266 asked for a show of hands in the church audience of people who had experienced police brutality or personally knew someone who did . all but a few hands went up .
