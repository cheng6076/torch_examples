the shape - shifting robots were sent in to assess the damage in one of the reactors that suffered a meltdown after a devastating earthquake and tsunami in march 2011*****0
@entity7 says the site 's still too dangerous for workers to enter*****0
the first robot , which was sent in on april 10 , stalled after moving about 10 meters , according to a statement released by @entity7*****1
a report and footage from the robot shows that a fallen object had blocked its path and left it stranded*****0
@entity7 decided to cut off the cable connected to the device on april 12 as it had already collected data on radiation levels in 14 of the 18 targeted locations , completing around two - thirds of the originally planned route*****1
the second robot was sent in on april 15 and collected data from all 11 points , as scheduled*****0
four years after the devastating nuclear crisis , the radiation levels inside the three damaged reactors are still extremely high and remain unsafe for people to enter*****1
decommissioning work is estimated to cost $ 50 billion and will take years to complete*****0
