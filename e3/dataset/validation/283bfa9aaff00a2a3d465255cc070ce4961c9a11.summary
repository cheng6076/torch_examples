( @entity1 ) the @entity0 is failing its partners . if you want to understand one of the reasons that terrorism has been allowed to spread , it is that the majority of our partners do not have credible and capable special operations forces to respond to and defeat the current threat -- and we 're not doing nearly enough to address the problem . the trouble is that little of our foreign military financing -- including the recent @entity16 -- goes toward this vital facet in our efforts to counter extremism . as a result , violent extremists are making troubling gains . it 's not because we do n't recognize the problem -- nor that we do n't talk the talk . the 2015 @entity26 speaks to the importance of @entity0 - led partnerships , while the 2014 @entity29 noted that we " will rebalance our counterterrorism efforts toward greater emphasis on building partnership capacity . " despite this apparent recognition , the @entity0 is not where it needs to be and instead finds itself constantly responding to crises instead of heading them off because of the failure to prioritize long - term investment in special operations units in key partner nations . as a result of this neglect , since the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , we have seen deadly terrorist attacks not just in the @entity44 , but also in @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 . just look at the case of @entity49 . on september 21 , 2013 , @entity51 jihadists attacked the @entity52 in @entity53 , executing dozens of unarmed men , women , and children . less than two years later , at @entity57 , @entity51 jihadists attacked university dormitories , butchering almost 150 people . the perpetrators were separating the @entity61 from the @entity62 and systemically executing the @entity61 before detonating their suicide vests . during both incidents , the @entity49 forces ' response was horribly executed . sadly , @entity49 is not the exception -- and it is by no means the only country missing out on vital @entity0 assistance . in 2015 , @entity0 taxpayers are providing $ 5.65 billion in foreign military finance , the majority of which is going to @entity75 and @entity76 . @entity49 , meanwhile , was slated to receive a mere $ 1.2 million . @entity77 , which is grappling with the rising threat of violent extremists in the shape of @entity81 , has been afforded only $ 600,000 . simply put , the @entity0 is spreading foreign military assistance too thin , while also failing to make necessary long - term commitments . it takes years to build special operations forces with credible capabilities . but although it is a worthwhile investment in terms of resources and energy , @entity0 security assistance is not supporting enduring programs that build credible special operations partners . the reality is that we are not selling or giving our partners the capabilities that are critical to defeating the imminent threats they face today in hybrid warfare . we are also failing to develop long - term programs of record , bringing to bear all elements of national power as we did with @entity104 . this program , as well as the recent @entity0 mission to support our @entity108 partners against @entity109 , demonstrates the power of a persistent presence by @entity112 when coupled with long - term funding and true interagency cooperation . true , the @entity116 and @entity117 program fulfills some needs , but money from the program only provides limited support -- it is an annual appropriation for " new and emerging " counterterrorist operations or to support military and stability operations in which the @entity0 armed forces are a participant . another program that builds special operations capacity , the @entity127 and training program , is also insufficient because it is ad hoc and meant to train @entity0 forces first and foremost , not our partners . with all this in mind , it is clearly time for @entity135 to step in and develop a dedicated program that builds out special operations in key nations to help bring the fight to the violent extremists in their own backyards . by investing everywhere , we are investing nowhere , which is why we need to make choices about where the @entity0 and its allies will see maximum benefit . the @entity0 has a choice -- reinforce failure and keep doing what we are doing or change course while we still have time . but to get this right , @entity135 needs to start out by conducting hearings to find out in detail what current programs are providing to defeat imminent threats . this will mean asking the @entity158 to lay out a detailed budget with necessary metrics to show what capabilities these programs will provide to counter hybrid threats and when those capabilities will be complete . at the same time , @entity135 needs to move beyond annual appropriations so that @entity168 and defense planners can do their job , too . attacks such as @entity171 and @entity52 are easy to plan , do not require large amounts of ordinance and can be done in almost any location in the world -- we can expect to see a lot more of these . but with competent and capable partners who are interoperable with other special operations forces and law enforcement , we can start to make progress . it goes without saying that special operations forces are not a panacea for defeating terrorism , the causes of which are complex and diverse . but having credible special operations forces is a great first step . and for many of our partner nations , the special operations capability we give them may be the best chance they have at protecting their populations from extremists at home .

( @entity1 ) the @entity0 is failing its partners*****0
if you want to understand one of the reasons that terrorism has been allowed to spread , it is that the majority of our partners do not have credible and capable special operations forces to respond to and defeat the current threat -- and we 're not doing nearly enough to address the problem*****1
the trouble is that little of our foreign military financing -- including the recent @entity16 -- goes toward this vital facet in our efforts to counter extremism*****1
as a result , violent extremists are making troubling gains*****0
it 's not because we do n't recognize the problem -- nor that we do n't talk the talk*****0
the 2015 @entity26 speaks to the importance of @entity0 - led partnerships , while the 2014 @entity29 noted that we " will rebalance our counterterrorism efforts toward greater emphasis on building partnership capacity*****0
" despite this apparent recognition , the @entity0 is not where it needs to be and instead finds itself constantly responding to crises instead of heading them off because of the failure to prioritize long - term investment in special operations units in key partner nations*****1
as a result of this neglect , since the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , we have seen deadly terrorist attacks not just in the @entity44 , but also in @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47*****0
just look at the case of @entity49*****0
on september 21 , 2013 , @entity51 jihadists attacked the @entity52 in @entity53 , executing dozens of unarmed men , women , and children*****0
less than two years later , at @entity57 , @entity51 jihadists attacked university dormitories , butchering almost 150 people*****0
the perpetrators were separating the @entity61 from the @entity62 and systemically executing the @entity61 before detonating their suicide vests*****0
during both incidents , the @entity49 forces ' response was horribly executed*****0
sadly , @entity49 is not the exception -- and it is by no means the only country missing out on vital @entity0 assistance*****1
in 2015 , @entity0 taxpayers are providing $ 5.65 billion in foreign military finance , the majority of which is going to @entity75 and @entity76*****1
@entity49 , meanwhile , was slated to receive a mere $ 1.2 million*****0
@entity77 , which is grappling with the rising threat of violent extremists in the shape of @entity81 , has been afforded only $ 600,000*****0
simply put , the @entity0 is spreading foreign military assistance too thin , while also failing to make necessary long - term commitments*****1
it takes years to build special operations forces with credible capabilities*****1
but although it is a worthwhile investment in terms of resources and energy , @entity0 security assistance is not supporting enduring programs that build credible special operations partners*****1
the reality is that we are not selling or giving our partners the capabilities that are critical to defeating the imminent threats they face today in hybrid warfare*****0
we are also failing to develop long - term programs of record , bringing to bear all elements of national power as we did with @entity104*****0
this program , as well as the recent @entity0 mission to support our @entity108 partners against @entity109 , demonstrates the power of a persistent presence by @entity112 when coupled with long - term funding and true interagency cooperation*****0
true , the @entity116 and @entity117 program fulfills some needs , but money from the program only provides limited support -- it is an annual appropriation for " new and emerging " counterterrorist operations or to support military and stability operations in which the @entity0 armed forces are a participant*****1
another program that builds special operations capacity , the @entity127 and training program , is also insufficient because it is ad hoc and meant to train @entity0 forces first and foremost , not our partners*****1
with all this in mind , it is clearly time for @entity135 to step in and develop a dedicated program that builds out special operations in key nations to help bring the fight to the violent extremists in their own backyards*****0
by investing everywhere , we are investing nowhere , which is why we need to make choices about where the @entity0 and its allies will see maximum benefit*****0
the @entity0 has a choice -- reinforce failure and keep doing what we are doing or change course while we still have time*****0
but to get this right , @entity135 needs to start out by conducting hearings to find out in detail what current programs are providing to defeat imminent threats*****0
this will mean asking the @entity158 to lay out a detailed budget with necessary metrics to show what capabilities these programs will provide to counter hybrid threats and when those capabilities will be complete*****0
at the same time , @entity135 needs to move beyond annual appropriations so that @entity168 and defense planners can do their job , too*****0
attacks such as @entity171 and @entity52 are easy to plan , do not require large amounts of ordinance and can be done in almost any location in the world -- we can expect to see a lot more of these*****0
but with competent and capable partners who are interoperable with other special operations forces and law enforcement , we can start to make progress*****1
it goes without saying that special operations forces are not a panacea for defeating terrorism , the causes of which are complex and diverse*****1
but having credible special operations forces is a great first step*****1
and for many of our partner nations , the special operations capability we give them may be the best chance they have at protecting their populations from extremists at home .*****0
