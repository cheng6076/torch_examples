( @entity0 ) you might call her a watchdog , because this @entity5 area doberman really has a thing for timepieces . she recently ate three . last thursday , @entity8 came home from work to find 5 - year - old mocha -- a pure bred fawn - colored doberman pincher -- hovering over a pile of screws , metal pieces , three watch heads and some chewed leather straps . " my husband , who 's the most calm person that i know , called me up and said , ' i 'm not quite sure if i should panic , ' " said @entity8 's wife , @entity17 . the 80 - pound @entity4 , whom her owners describe as " more goofy than scary , " had pulled down a basket of wrist wear from a shelf in their bedroom and eaten nearly all the contents . @entity17 knew that @entity11 would n't be able to pass all that leather on her own . the couple took her to the @entity28 's @entity27 , a 24 - hour emergency and specialty hospital , where a veterinarian performed a 3 - hour endoscopy to explore the contents of her belly . mocha was a repeat offender : just last summer , she got very sick and had to have emergency stomach surgery after a piece of plastic from an orange juice container perforated her intestine . she had 28 staples down her belly and 10 inches of intestine removed , @entity17 said . fortunately this time , the jewelry remains were still in @entity11 's belly and had not made their way into the digestive tract . the x-ray , however , was disturbing . @entity17 and her husband were just expecting to see a couple metal pieces . " it just looked like a christmas tree and i almost threw up , " @entity17 said . the veterinarian removed " about a pound of leather straps and metal pieces and detritus " during the endoscopy , and let nature take its course for the remaining pieces , @entity28 spokesman @entity54 said . as of friday , @entity11 was no worse for wear . the hospital sees dozens of cases each week of dogs ingesting foreign objects , and is trained to look for the symptoms of blockages -- typically lethargy , not eating and vomiting , @entity54 said . they once saw a golden retriever who had stopped eating and found 43 pacifiers in her belly . ( apparently she was taking them from babies at the park . ) and there was the 100 - pound bull mastiff who ate his owner 's brie that was set out for a party -- along with the cheese knife . the night mocha stayed in the hospital , a nervous @entity17 stayed awake reading stories about dogs ingesting watches and other objects . she found one article about a @entity96 whose owner knew something was awry only when he heard an alarm go off from his dog 's belly . " we 've taken every imaginable thing that could fit down the gullet of a dog out with surgery , " @entity54 said . " there 's some evolutionary traits that some dogs have that lead them to eat first and think later ... and some of them are so food motivated that anything with a scent could be associated with food , and they go for it . " @entity11 likes to suck on fleece blankets and has been known to eat rubber ear buds or hair elastics , but nothing like a pile of jewelry , @entity17 said . her breeder wondered if the dog was acting out of anxiety . that day , @entity17 had left @entity11 in a different apartment the couple owns that the dog was n't as used to . the breeder told @entity17 that @entity130 are particularly known to get anxious and do these sort of things . " she had a dog that actually consumed her whole dog bed , " @entity17 said . from now on , @entity17 said she will put @entity11 in a crate if the dog will be staying somewhere new . follow - up x-rays monday on @entity11 showed a few pieces of metal left , " but they were moving along " and the vet expected her to pass them naturally . @entity17 said @entity142 was " her playful , energetic , curious @entity4 self . " but now that she thinks of it , the timing of this whole incident is a little suspicious . " my husband was all excited about the new @entity148 watch , but could n't justify a reason to purchase it since he owned three watches , " she said . " i am convinced that he and @entity11 joined forces here to destroy all of his current watches in order to make room for @entity148 's new watch . "
