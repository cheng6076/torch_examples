( @entity0 ) @entity2 's live telecast of the @entity3 on saturday night , hosted by @entity4 of " @entity5 , " was not @entity7 's finest hour , though the entire affair seemed like five of @entity2 's longest hours . even so , there were some genuinely funny moments , although the ratio was low , and you had to be patient to get to them . but when you step back and look at the event as a whole , and appreciate what 's really happening -- in terms of press freedoms and even a @entity22 president willing and able to poke fun at himself as well as others -- it 's hard not to think of this particular @entity26 - meets - showbiz event as a wonderfully @entity22 exercise in tolerance and good humor . that being said , it 's a very tough room -- and not just because the @entity34 ballroom is so cavernous . more than 2,000 credentialed @entity3 journalists and their mostly celebrity guests convened for the occasion . and convened , and convened , and convened , as time dragged on and dinner was served late . president @entity41 , as @entity7 's warm - up act , did n't hit the podium until 10:20 p.m. ( @entity7 got her turn at 10:45 . ) @entity41 , as in past years , came out strong -- a tough act to follow for any comedian . he had strong comedy lines and delivered them with timing that many stand - up comics would envy . noting his lame - duck status , @entity41 said his advisers asked him if he had a bucket list . " i have something that rhymes with bucket list , " he claimed to have replied . @entity41 , noting the night 's guest speaker , said , " on ' @entity5 , ' @entity4 impersonates @entity0 anchor @entity56 . " then , after a brief but well - timed pause , he added , " which is surprising , because usually , the only people impersonating journalists on @entity0 are journalists on @entity0 . " @entity41 was nailing his own punch lines frequently , and perfectly . then , to up the ante on his time at the podium , he welcomed his " anger translator " -- a recurring character played by @entity68 on @entity70 's " @entity69 . " it was a clever surprise , and the crowd reacted with surprising enthusiasm ( i would n't have presumed most of them knew of @entity68 's character or his series ) , though @entity68 's jokes lost something in the translation , and did n't pack the punch of @entity41 's . but the bit ended with a great twist : @entity41 himself getting so worked up about a snowball being carried into @entity86 to denounce global warming that the president 's " anger translator " had to calm @entity41 down instead . and then came @entity4 , with a sly opening line referring not only to her appearance as one of the few female guest speakers at the correspondents ' dinner , but to the upcoming 2016 presidential election . " feels right , " she said , " to have a woman following president @entity41 . " from there , the crowd seemed as tough as advertised , with " oohs " often as loud as laughter , as @entity7 went from one target to another . she even got " oohs " when her targets were outside the room , as when she said , noting how @entity41 has aged visibly in office , " your hair is so white now , it can talk back to the police . " but the seemingly tepid response to @entity7 's routine may have been partly due to the late hour . she came on after not only the dinner service and @entity41 , but after scholarship awards , correspondent awards and tributes and other bits of official business . and her routine was n't over until 11:08 p.m. -- making it a longer tv show than even the @entity122 . before the main event finally began , @entity2 filled the time scanning the room with its cameras , but providing only ambient sound with very few identifying voice - overs or prerecorded features . once in a while , you could see someone recognizable in the large , oddly eclectic crowd : @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 . for the most part , though , it was like playing a frustratingly difficult @entity26 game of spot - the - face - in - the - crowd -- a sort of " who 's @entity143 ? " and after a few hours watching a gaggle of people chat and eat , all i wanted to do was go home . and i was already home . but i stayed tuned , just so i could watch , and grade , the results . final tally : @entity41 gets an @entity158 , @entity68 a c , @entity4 a b - , and the entire telecast and event an @entity154 for democracy -- but a d as television .

( @entity0 ) @entity2 's live telecast of the @entity3 on saturday night , hosted by @entity4 of " @entity5 , " was not @entity7 's finest hour , though the entire affair seemed like five of @entity2 's longest hours*****1
even so , there were some genuinely funny moments , although the ratio was low , and you had to be patient to get to them*****0
but when you step back and look at the event as a whole , and appreciate what 's really happening -- in terms of press freedoms and even a @entity22 president willing and able to poke fun at himself as well as others -- it 's hard not to think of this particular @entity26 - meets - showbiz event as a wonderfully @entity22 exercise in tolerance and good humor*****0
that being said , it 's a very tough room -- and not just because the @entity34 ballroom is so cavernous*****0
more than 2,000 credentialed @entity3 journalists and their mostly celebrity guests convened for the occasion*****0
and convened , and convened , and convened , as time dragged on and dinner was served late*****0
president @entity41 , as @entity7 's warm - up act , did n't hit the podium until 10:20 p.m. ( @entity7 got her turn at 10:45*****1
) @entity41 , as in past years , came out strong -- a tough act to follow for any comedian*****1
he had strong comedy lines and delivered them with timing that many stand - up comics would envy*****0
noting his lame - duck status , @entity41 said his advisers asked him if he had a bucket list*****0
" i have something that rhymes with bucket list , " he claimed to have replied*****0
@entity41 , noting the night 's guest speaker , said , " on ' @entity5 , ' @entity4 impersonates @entity0 anchor @entity56*****1
" then , after a brief but well - timed pause , he added , " which is surprising , because usually , the only people impersonating journalists on @entity0 are journalists on @entity0*****0
" @entity41 was nailing his own punch lines frequently , and perfectly*****0
then , to up the ante on his time at the podium , he welcomed his " anger translator " -- a recurring character played by @entity68 on @entity70 's " @entity69*****1
" it was a clever surprise , and the crowd reacted with surprising enthusiasm ( i would n't have presumed most of them knew of @entity68 's character or his series ) , though @entity68 's jokes lost something in the translation , and did n't pack the punch of @entity41 's*****1
but the bit ended with a great twist : @entity41 himself getting so worked up about a snowball being carried into @entity86 to denounce global warming that the president 's " anger translator " had to calm @entity41 down instead*****1
and then came @entity4 , with a sly opening line referring not only to her appearance as one of the few female guest speakers at the correspondents ' dinner , but to the upcoming 2016 presidential election*****1
" feels right , " she said , " to have a woman following president @entity41*****0
