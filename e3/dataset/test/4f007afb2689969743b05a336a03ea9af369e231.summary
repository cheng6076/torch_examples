( @entity3 ) the night before her daughter 's first triathlon , @entity0 could tell the child was nervous . @entity5 and her younger sister , @entity7 , are athletic , loud , curious , wild - haired kids . they grew up watching their mother compete in races and @entity5 had asked to sign up for her own . still , as they laid out everything she 'd need the next day , @entity12 , a photographer , could tell she was afraid . " why do n't we get a picture ? " @entity12 asked @entity5 , now 9 . " show me your strongest face , show me your bravest face , even if you do n't feel that way right now . " as she pulled the image up on her screen , she got chills from her daughter 's direct stare . she looked , @entity12 said , like " a little badass . " " you 're going to be totally fine , " @entity12 showed her . " look at how tough you are . " the next day , @entity5 participated in her race , and loved it . looking back , " i wanted her to remember that she was scared and she went through with it , sort of as a memento of her conquering a fear , " said @entity12 , who lives near @entity32 . " as a mom , i really wanted to get a good picture of it , too . " the photo is one of @entity12 's favorites from her series , " @entity43 is the @entity44 . " it covers the last two years , but evolved from @entity12 's early days behind a camera , when she shot daily images of her girls to expand her knowledge of lighting and composition . it seemed that most images of little girls showcased perfectly placed hair bows , forced smiles and @entity59 - smooth skin . @entity60 did n't . " i did n't want to shoot pictures like that . i did n't want girls to think they had to look like that , " said @entity12 , whose daughters are now 6 and 9 . " whoever they were , however they were , was worthy of an image . whatever they were was good enough . " so , she shot her girls and their friends as they were -- freckled , muddy , screaming , laughing , jumping in the pool , collecting worms in the creek , barreling into the wilderness of early adolescence on skateboards and bicycles . " i want to capture them before they lose that sense of ' i 'm so awesome . ' i wanted them to keep that as long as they could , " @entity12 said . " i started to shoot with that in mind , but it was already there . " the girls pose for an occasional portrait , but most are kid - inspired moments , shaped by childish wonderment and energy . as parents , @entity12 and her husband encourage their girls to play outside , make new friends and try new things without worrying about grass - stained knees and knots in their hair , @entity12 said . now , the girls have the confidence and curiosity to do it on their own . " they 're just being themselves , and i 'm just recording it , " @entity12 said . responses to the images are mostly positive , @entity12 said , but there 's the occasional complaint that she 's showing just one type of girl . it 's true , @entity12 said : they 're the ones she 's raising , the only ones whose adventures she can document 24/7 . she hopes the project inspires parents to find their own creative ways to capture their children 's lives . more important , she wants kids to see they can be strong in whatever they are and whatever they hope to be . @entity12 's own kids still surprise her . " @entity7 is a beautiful singer . when i hear her sing , it makes me cry , " @entity12 said . " @entity5 has this amazing , kind heart that cares more about the experience than the win . it 's something that i did not teach her . " whatever it is , it 's ok . "
