( @entity2 ) for years , when i 'd tell new friends i was half - @entity3 , a puzzled look would cross their faces , before they 'd ask something like , " do you have a country ?

" in fact , one of our most famous @entity14 , @entity16 , was better known for her @entity19 - winning portrayals of @entity20 , and had dropped her own identifying surname . the decimation of our people , too , was reduced to a footnote -- if we were lucky -- in tomes about @entity26 , when more than one million @entity14 were killed during the last days of the @entity27 . most of the time , though , the coverage was about how @entity14 and @entity29 hate each other like cats and dogs , that the @entity29 continue to deny that ethnic cleansing occurred , saying the @entity14 had hatched a rebellion , and that the leaders had no choice but to deport them from their homes and put them on the road that led to their deaths . even @entity40 had brushed us aside , uttering , just before invading @entity41 in september 1939 : " who , after all , speaks today of the annihilation of the @entity14 ?

when the @entity103 first rose to fame , many @entity14 cringed over their potboiler storyline , their million - dollar weddings to basketball players and rappers , multiple divorces , and a clothing line at @entity111*****1
through their fame , though , people began to learn about @entity14 -- even people outside @entity115 , where the @entity3 population is as thick as the @entity49 hair*****1
that @entity118 may also have been equating the ancient culture with the latest " keeping up with the @entity49 " plotline was a source of discomfort for the community*****1

and we would deflate when it would n't come to fruition*****0
and every april 24 , the day in 1915 when @entity27 @entity29 began rounding up the community 's intellectual leaders , we mobilized*****1

we also press forward on the academic front , holding conferences on the latest research around the world , exulting in the discovery of yet another bit of information that would surely make the world reckon , that would counter @entity29 's steadfast pressure on the @entity118 to not acknowledge the atrocities*****0
and still , disappointingly , early reports surfaced yet once more , as in years before , that @entity130 has decided again on this year 's anniversary not to use the g - word*****0
despite all the setbacks , the @entity14 will continue to speak out , and hopefully find some hallowed ground , too , to stand with @entity29 to heal*****0
after all , we 've learned an increased dialogue can come from the most surprising places*****0
this year , it took a reality star , famous for balancing a cocktail on her rump , to catapult it to the top of the news once again , like it was on december 15 , 1915 , when headlines like " @entity14 or in @entity178 , " splashed across the @entity179 and other international media*****1
after a century of trying to raise awareness , what we needed all along was a television and @entity185 persona to join us -- especially one who shares everything on every platform -- to shed light on a crime that occurred back when telegrams were the speedy form of communication , and photographic plates of the killings had to be smuggled out in a belt , rather than blasted instantaneously with a tweet*****0
