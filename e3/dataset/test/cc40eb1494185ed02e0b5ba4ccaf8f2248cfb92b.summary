" the days were long and tedious . now it was over . " it 's been an incredibly emotional toll on all of us , " @entity20 told @entity8 's @entity21 thursday in the first nationally televised interview with members of the jury . a day earlier , @entity20 , the jury foreperson , announced the first - degree murder conviction in the 2013 shooting death of @entity13 's onetime friend @entity30 . @entity20 said she was struck by the viciousness of multiple gunshots . " you shot him once but you kept going and you shot him six times . there 's no need for that and there 's no need to use a gun . period . " before the trial , at least one juror -- @entity44 -- had n't heard of the 25 - year - old defendant who has now gone from a $ 40 million pro-football contract to a term of life without parole in a maximum - security prison . but @entity51 watches the @entity52 every sunday during the football season . she said so on her jury questionnaire . " i knew of him as a football player , not a person , " she said . it did n't affect her vote to convict , she said . it did n't matter that he was a football player , she said . nor did it matter whether he actually pulled the trigger in the murder . " to leave your friend on the ground , knowing that he 's not there anymore -- he 's either dead or he 's going to die -- that 's indifference , " @entity66 said of @entity13 . " he did n't need to pull the trigger . " that word -- " indifference " -- was used multiple times by members of the jury . @entity78 said he was struck by testimony and video evidence that @entity13 and two co-defendants were sunbathing poolside hours after the slaying , drinking smoothies . @entity13 at times left his then - 8 - month - old daughter with the two men . that indifference " surprised a lot of us , " @entity78 said . he stressed the fact that @entity13 played football for a living did n't influence the jury 's decision . " it does n't matter how much money you have or how much money you make . we 're all people , and we 're all equal , and we all deserve the same fair trial , and that 's what we wanted to make sure we gave him , " @entity78 said . @entity30 was seen june 17 , 2013 , around 2:30 a.m. with @entity13 and @entity13 's friends , @entity105 and @entity106 , in a rented silver @entity108 . later that day , a jogger found his body . he had been shot six times , according to prosecutors . @entity106 and @entity105 , who were also charged with murder , have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately . what 's next for @entity13 ? @entity44 -- the juror who had n't heard of @entity13 before the trial -- said that , for her , the first shot was enough . " there was no need for the other five , " she said . " one shot for me is cruelty . " @entity121 and other jurors said they were surprised to receive calls from friends congratulating them after the verdict . " who won ? " she asked " @entity30 did n't win . ( his mother ) did n't bring back her son . did mr. @entity13 win ? no , because he 's going to serve the rest of his life in jail and he 's 25 years old . the worst part for me is : how about that little girl that 's never going to see her father again ?

" the jurors declined to talk about the dynamics inside the jury room , choosing instead to keep the focus on the evidence presented during trial . they conveyed a sense of gravity about their task .
