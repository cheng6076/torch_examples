( @entity0 ) thinking about presidential candidates ? apparently , hormones are a major factor one should consider*****0
according to one female businesswoman in @entity6 , @entity4 should n't be president because her hormones might make her so irrational she 'll start an unnecessary war*****1
when @entity10 waged an unnecessary war in @entity12 -- was his testosterone to blame ? as @entity16 , the ceo of @entity17 , sees it : " we 're built differently , we have different hormones*****1
in the world that we live in , i understand that there 's equal rights and that 's a wonderful thing and i support all of that*****0
i do n't support a woman being president*****0
" " with the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war , " @entity16 wrote in a @entity27 post*****1
if @entity16 is concerned about hormones impacting decisions in the @entity34 , she 'd be better off worrying about the male candidates for president*****1
throughout history , male hormones have indeed impaired some male leaders ' decision - making*****0
studies show that women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks than their male counterparts*****0
if science does n't convince you , just @entity48 " cheating politicians " for the long and sordid list of men like @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 , whose hormones got the best of them*****0
@entity16 has taken a lot of flak for her " biblically " inspired beliefs , but she 's not the only one who 's arguing that a woman 's hormones are a legitimate leadership concern*****1
@entity63 declared @entity4 the " perfect " age to be president , because she 's a postmenopausal woman who is " biologically primed " to lead*****1
( she also happens to be a former first lady , senator and secretary of state*****0
) i 'm not joking*****0
believe me , i wish i were*****0
no wonder @entity71 left " @entity74 " before the election cycle ramps up in full swing*****0
if discussions about a candidate 's hormones are what we have to look forward to , the state of presidential politics is depressing indeed*****1
but underneath the biochemistry debate is a much scarier consideration : the bias against women in the workplace is so well established that even in 2015 , a female candidate will be hard - pressed to get elected unless we have a serious discussion about ending gender bias*****1
we want to believe that we live in a world where our daughters can do anything and be anything*****0
and you 'd think they could -- they outnumber boys in college , graduate school and the work force*****0
but what will limit their potential is not biochemistry or ability , but a bias in how women and girls are viewed*****1
unfortunately , @entity16 ' view of women is not unique*****0
some people believe women have " our place " and that place is not at the table*****0
they 'll tell your daughter to " go for it " but believe she is n't qualified to fulfill her dreams*****0
in a compelling series about women and work , @entity120 professor @entity119 and @entity27 coo @entity121 lay out the startling facts about the bias women face at work and the profound benefit of eradicating gender stereotypes*****1
the evidence of bias is undeniable and the examples are endless*****0
it 's overt : there are more men on corporate boards named @entity53 , @entity137 , @entity138 or @entity139 than there are women on boards altogether*****1
the bias is also covert : when students rate their favorite professors , they describe the men as " geniuses " and the women as " nice*****1
" the bias is real , yet so many of us are blind to it*****0
@entity4 might not be the perfect candidate , but the fact that she is a woman will make her road to the @entity157 a much steeper climb*****1
that 's not just a problem for @entity160 -- it 's a problem for @entity162 , independents , everyone*****0
the fact is , equality benefits everyone*****0
it 's better for the bottom line ( companies with more women in leadership roles make more money )*****1
it 's great for kids because children with involved fathers are happier , healthier , and more successful*****0
it 's great for marriages because couples that share responsibilities have stronger marriages*****0
and it 's great for corporate teams because diverse teams and companies produce better results*****0
our nation , our economy and our families would be much stronger if half of our companies were run by women and half of our households were run by men*****0
it 's not enough to say to our daughters : " you can be anything you want to be*****0
" what we need to say is : " you can be anything you want to be , despite what some people might think -- and what they think is wrong*****0
" @entity16 said that if @entity207 is elected , she is " moving to @entity206 " because " a female should n't be president*****0
" apparently @entity16 knows as much about women and leadership as she knows about @entity206 : @entity212 became the country 's first female prime minister in 1993*****1
