( @entity0 ) @entity2 's groundbreaking work , " @entity3 , " is a series of 60 small paintings with text depicting the lives of millions of @entity9 blacks as they moved from the oppressive @entity10 to the promise of a better life in the @entity13*****0
one frame in particular , no. 22 , shows three black men dressed in their sunday best , handcuffed , heads bowed standing in front of a window adorned with prison bars*****0
the caption reads : " another of the social causes of the migrants ' leaving was that at times they did not feel safe , or it was not the best thing to be found on the streets late at night*****0
they were arrested on the slightest provocation*****0
" @entity2 painted this picture around 1940*****0
this is important to know because there are some people who blame president @entity34 for racial tension in @entity36 as if the march on @entity37 scrubbed away the lasting effects of 300 years of inequality*****0
no. 22 was painted before hip - hop became the piñata for conservative talk show hosts to bash and before sagging pants became a popular fashion statement*****0
some of us keep looking for a new reason why this old problem continues to haunt us because to think otherwise requires effort*****0
it 's a lot easier to retweet a dr. @entity52 meme*****0
it is more convenient to say the violence began when rioters threw bricks at police and not when a city 's @entity58 began terrorizing its residents*****0
we criticize @entity63 's mayor for not " restoring order " as if paying victims of police brutality nearly $ 6 million in a four - year span is " order*****0
" now , some people are partially blaming the 2013 movie " @entity71 " for the uprising in @entity63 as if the 1996 riots in @entity74 , @entity75 , happened on a different planet*****1
or that the more than 100 cases of @entity63 police brutality that were either lost or settled out of court since 2011 provide no insight as to what the residents have been dealing with for some time*****0
an 87 - year - old grandmother had her shoulder broken by overzealous police , and sen. @entity86 -- @entity87 bless him -- suggested the rise in absentee fathers is the reason for this latest clash*****0
it is true only 34 % of black children live in a two - family household today , and i do believe that is a problem*****0
soul searching , as the president suggested , is something that needs to be had by all*****0
but it is also true that 65 % of black children lived with both parents in 1960 , and yet there was still a lack of trust between the police and the minority community*****0
sen. @entity86 's rationale falls apart when you consider that @entity115 was shot and killed by police at a @entity117 in @entity118 while on the phone talking with the mother of his two children*****0
@entity115 's father was literally playing with his two grandchildren as his son was being gunned down*****0
in 1971 , @entity125 cracked the @entity126 on the pop charts with " @entity128 , " which included the lines : crime is increasing trigger happy policing panic is spreading @entity87 knows where we 're heading and yet so many look at the protests , uprisings and yes , sometimes riots , with this incredulous demeanor as if the raw emotions captured on camera are materializing out of thin air*****0
no backdrop*****0
no historical context*****0
television journalists asking questions that seem to characterize the recent developments as unexplained anger detached from any tangible issue*****0
it is as if they believe the absence of burning crosses translated into peace and harmony*****0
meanwhile , @entity155 state police want people to believe @entity157 shot himself in the chest while handcuffed sitting in the back of a police car*****0
how can there be peace when the @entity162 found black residents in @entity164 were preyed upon for years by a corrupt @entity58 ? where is the harmony when the average white household has 13 times the wealth of its black counterpart ? and we know the impact wealth has on education , housing and mortality*****0
now there is video of police in @entity178 , @entity179 , celebrating the beating of a suspect as he sits nearby with broken ribs , a head injury and bleeding*****0
the officers fist pump and laugh*****0
one of them even appears to joyfully re-enact parts of the incident in plain view of @entity191 , the man in custody*****0
and when the incident in question was under investigation , the @entity193 suppressed the video*****0
two months would go by before the public saw what we are paying for*****0
but at least we saw it*****0
in @entity203 , the police department has yet to release dash cam video of the fatal encounter officers had with 17 - year - old @entity206 last october*****0
the report said an officer fired shots into @entity206 's chest after the teen lunged at them with a knife*****0
witnesses said the shooting was unjustified*****0
the autopsy shows @entity206 was shot 16 times from a variety of angles by the officer*****0
the @entity221 recently approved a $ 5 million settlement but maintains there was no wrongdoing*****0
the video could shed some light on what really happened ... which may explain why we have yet to see it*****1
this comes on the heels of mayor @entity232 establishing a $ 5.5 million reparations fund for victims of former @entity236 commander @entity235*****0
for three decades @entity235 and his team ran a torture ring that used electric shock , burned and beat up more than 100 black men*****0
and some look at @entity63 and the protests happening all around the country and wonder where all of this rage is coming from ? this mistrust did n't come from somewhere*****1
it 's always been here*****0
woven in the comedic deliveries of @entity249 , @entity250 and @entity251 ; saturated within the prose of @entity253 , @entity254 and @entity255 ; heard in soulful cries of @entity258 's " @entity257 " to @entity259 standing on an @entity261 stage singing " one day , when the glory comes it will be ours*****0
" for decades , the works of black artists have explicitly talked about the baltimores of this country and though their work has been celebrated and curated , the message remains lost*****0
why else would someone believe sagging pants and hoodies are to blame for mass incarcerations ? that president @entity34 is the reason why some blacks are frustrated with police and not the dynamic beautifully captured by @entity2 75 years ago*****0
before president @entity278 started the war on drugs*****0
before @entity281 started selling loose cigarettes in @entity283*****0
before @entity63 became the setting of a critically acclaimed tv show*****0
there is n't a new reason why @entity289 's death triggered outrage*****0
just new ways for people to validate apathy and explain away racism .*****1
