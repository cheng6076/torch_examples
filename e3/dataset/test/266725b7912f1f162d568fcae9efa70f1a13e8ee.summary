" but if you look at the spread of the earthquake a lot of the rural areas have been hit as well . the information we received from the field is that 80 % of the houses in these rural areas have been destroyed . " the quake was the strongest in the region in more than 80 years . residents are used to earthquakes in @entity2 , and many thought the start of saturday 's quake was a tremor , until the earth kept shaking and buildings crashed down . " the reports of the devastation are still coming in and the numbers of people killed , injured and affected by this earthquake continue to rise , " said @entity87 ban ki - moon in a statement . " it is clear that very many lives have been lost . " an estimated 4.6 million people in the region were exposed to tremors from the @entity2 earthquake , the @entity96 said via @entity101 . thirty out of 75 @entity2 districts were affected by the quake . in neighboring @entity109 , roads buckled , buildings collapsed and at least 13 people were killed , @entity105 's state media reported , citing local authorities . separately , at least four @entity105 citizens in @entity2 -- two workers with a @entity105 company , a tourist and a mountaineer -- have been killed , state media reported , citing the @entity116 in @entity1 . officials in @entity118 confirmed at least 34 deaths in three states from the @entity2 quake . the quake struck at 11:56 a.m. local time ( 2:11 a.m. et ) and was centered less than 50 miles northwest of @entity1 . it occurred at a depth of 9.3 miles , which is considered shallow and more damaging than a deeper quake . it was reported by people in the area as having lasted a long time . one person said he felt as if he were on a ship in rough seas . @entity1 sits in a valley surrounded by the @entity135 . @entity136 , a reporter with @entity137 , told @entity3 she was wandering at an ancient temple complex at the moment of the earthquake . several temples collapsed around her , she said . " it 's not too often you find yourself in a situation where you have to run for your life , " @entity136 said , adding that she sought shelter under the table of a cafe . " it was utterly terrifying . " @entity136 watched as residents picked through the rubble of a destroyed temple . they found 12 bodies . " unfortunately , that search was not fruitful , " @entity136 said . " there were 12 bodies at least pulled from the rubble in the square . this was just one of several historical temple complexes severely affected by the earthquake . " the @entity44 tower , the landmark nine - story structure , was packed with people when it collapsed . @entity136 said at least 50 bodies were pulled from the ruins of @entity44 . the tower , built in 1832 , provided visitors with a panoramic view of the @entity171 . are you in @entity2 or have loved ones affected ? please share with us if you are in a safe place . @entity176 , a journalist in @entity1 , told @entity3 by telephone that this appeared to be " the most massive earthquake to hit central @entity2 since 1934 . " in that quake , which was 8.1 magnitude and centered near @entity47 , more than 10,000 people were killed . @entity181 , a freelance photographer , was sitting in a coffee shop in @entity1 's @entity184 district . it appeared to be a minor tremor at first but gradually gained intensity , he told @entity3 . thousands poured onto the streets of the densely populated tourist hub . " this region is no stranger to earthquakes , " he said . " a lot of people had the same feeling : this is a tremor , it passed . when that was n't the case , they were in uncharted territory ... it 's basically an unwritten book . " outside the coffee shop , @entity181 said he saw a group of women gather near what had been a six - story building . one woman said children were trapped beneath rubble . " we ran over and ran around the rubble and could n't hear anything , " he said . " there was no chance that they survived . " nearby , another building had come down on an area where locals went to do laundry and collect water , @entity181 said . a voice was heard coming from the rubble . " a group of mainly tourists started gathering rocks , hammers and pickaxes and breaking through a re-enforced concrete wall to reach this guy ... it took about two hours of smashing through wall and cutting rebar with a hacksaw to pull him out alive . " two bodies were found near the spot where the man was rescued , @entity181 said . not far away , lay the bodies of three or four women . " who knows how many other bodies lie beneath the rubble ? " he said . the streets of @entity1 were packed with thousands of locals and tourists who did n't want to go back to their homes or hotels because of recurring aftershocks . @entity251 and his wife had just checked into a hotel in @entity1 when the earthquake struck . " it felt like it went on forever , " the @entity256 resident said . witnesses : " people are panicked , running down to street " outside , people ran onto the street , with the temblor knocking some off their feet . a huge section of a brick wall crushed motorcycles and a car . later , as they walked around the city , an aftershock hit . " people were screaming and looking around , " he said . " there were people clearly shaken , upset , crying . " @entity276 , spokesman for the @entity277 , told @entity3 that weak building codes in @entity2 contributed to the amount of structural damage . " building codes in @entity1 itself have not been well upheld in recent years , " he said . " efforts have been made over the last few years to strengthen these building codes but , unfortunately , this comes too late for the many thousands of buildings that have gone up across the @entity171 over the last 20 years that did not adhere to the building codes . " @entity290 , 48 , a @entity3 security guard in @entity291 , said he spoke by telephone with relatives in @entity1 and @entity294 , a city about 125 miles ( 200 kilometers ) west of the capital . they were fine and were staying on streets . " everybody 's in shock , " he said . " they never felt an earthquake that big .
