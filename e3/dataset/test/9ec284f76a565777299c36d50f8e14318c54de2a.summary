( @entity0 ) a year ago @entity1 published a story with the following headline : @entity4 , a @entity5 , mulls 2016 run for president . the story ticked off items on @entity4 's conservative things - to - do list while also noting his close ties to the deep - pocketed @entity5 brothers , as well as other right - wing lobbying groups . last august the @entity14 governor was in @entity15 for an @entity17 event ; the group is backed by the conservative @entity5 brothers , and supported gov. @entity4 's tax - slashing budget . now , @entity4 is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law last week that opens the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians . why would @entity4 ignore the pleas of @entity14 's @entity29 as well as the @entity31 mayor of his state capital and sign such a bill ? because there 's a very powerful wing of his party that wants a conservative as its 2016 candidate and this bill was @entity4 's way of shoring up his street cred . it is also the reason why @entity31 @entity44 , @entity4 's fellow @entity45 hopeful , who is viewed as a little light in that category , was first to rush in to defend @entity4 and the law . one lesson here : just because more than 70 % of the country now lives in states where same - sex marriage is legal does not mean 70 % of the country is happy about it . backlash aside , the fact is @entity4 has scored a lot of points this week among ultraconservatives . and while that may not be enough to get him over this political hump , the very public debate that now embroils him — and @entity63 gov. @entity62 , and likely 14 other states considering similar proposals this year -- is more than enough to drag the entire @entity31 field farther to the right than the party had hoped . @entity4 : ' was i expecting this kind of backlash ? @entity74 no. ' for there is no way a @entity31 can get through the pending primary without denouncing lgbt rights , which unfortunately will turn numerous @entity79 into single - issue voters . i foolishly hoped the issue of lgbt rights would be a bit player in the 2016 general election , overshadowed by foreign policy and the economy . instead it looks like it 's going to be dragged down to a replay of @entity91 's " cultural war " speech , during which he told the @entity92 : " we stand with ( @entity94 ) against the amoral idea that gay and lesbian couples should have the same standing in law as married men and women " and later followed with " there is a religious war going on in this country . it is a cultural war , as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the @entity110 itself . for this war is for the soul of @entity79 . " progressives may enjoy watching @entity4 's temporary fall from grace , but his policy rhetoric has echoed that of 2016 hopeful sen. @entity118 of @entity119 , who has indicated a federal ban on same - sex marriage is not off the @entity31 table . and even if you think neither @entity4 nor @entity44 nor @entity118 will win the nomination , someone has to . in light of that , listen to conservative former @entity63 gov. @entity128 , a potential 2016 candidate describing conservatives ' discomfort with same - sex marriage : " it 's like asking someone who 's @entity132 to start serving bacon - wrapped shrimp in their deli . " or @entity137 gov. @entity136 : " i certainly will support @entity118 and others that are talking about making ... a constitutional amendment to allow states to continue to define marriage .

the story ticked off items on @entity4 's conservative things - to - do list while also noting his close ties to the deep - pocketed @entity5 brothers , as well as other right - wing lobbying groups*****0
last august the @entity14 governor was in @entity15 for an @entity17 event ; the group is backed by the conservative @entity5 brothers , and supported gov. @entity4 's tax - slashing budget*****0
now , @entity4 is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law last week that opens the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians*****0
why would @entity4 ignore the pleas of @entity14 's @entity29 as well as the @entity31 mayor of his state capital and sign such a bill ? because there 's a very powerful wing of his party that wants a conservative as its 2016 candidate and this bill was @entity4 's way of shoring up his street cred*****1
it is also the reason why @entity31 @entity44 , @entity4 's fellow @entity45 hopeful , who is viewed as a little light in that category , was first to rush in to defend @entity4 and the law*****1
one lesson here : just because more than 70 % of the country now lives in states where same - sex marriage is legal does not mean 70 % of the country is happy about it*****0
backlash aside , the fact is @entity4 has scored a lot of points this week among ultraconservatives*****0
