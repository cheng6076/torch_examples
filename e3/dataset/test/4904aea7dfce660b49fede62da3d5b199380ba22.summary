@entity3 , @entity4 ( @entity5 ) it is a strangely detached scene for the close of @entity9 's longest war : military trainers bouncing between multi-million dollar , high security bases , on @entity1 , miles from the front line . but it is how @entity13 wants this to be . and even though the departure of @entity9 troops will be fractionally slower , they will all be inside the @entity9 embassy by the end of next year , making these some of their last weeks outside of the wire . we are near @entity23 , at a regional logistics hub for the @entity4 police force -- a generous facility that was originally intended to resupply the entire east of the country with uniforms , ammunition , even fuel for vehicles . the intentions , first hatched in 2011 when the @entity9 had tens of thousands of troops and still large ambitions for their war here , were large in scale . but the project has been handed between rotations of @entity9 officers and is perhaps a little distant from its first conception . we are taken on a proud tour of a series of clean and newly painted blocks . dozens of @entity4 police gather there , and mill around , waiting for their commanders to arrive . @entity51 's @entity4 series : @entity4 forced to marry her rapist yet a few problems are immediately visible . there are no doorhandles on the outer doors -- we 're told they 've been removed while a new master key is being sought . there seem to be few supplies in the actual hub . we ask the @entity4 policemen how many of them get resupplied there , at this stage , four months since it opened , and they say : none . about 20 units a month file paperwork for resupply in the base , but supplies often still come from where they did before -- @entity3 . @entity9 officials told us they are optimistic the logistical road ahead can be smoothed -- that in the 18 plus months they have left they can get the @entity4 army and police up to furnishing themselves with the supply lines they need . but here , now , that seems far away . as does the base , incidentally . it 's quite a rough drive from the main road , surrounded by hills , and with at best patchy cellphone coverage -- far from ideal for a transit hub . @entity51 's @entity4 series : @entity89 recruits in @entity91 territory and it is far away in terms of its cost . like so much in the most costly of wars , its price tag may have made sense in briefings on @entity101 , where effectiveness is gauged in millions , but here in dusty eastern @entity4 , it seems exorbitant . this as - yet , partially functional resupply hub cost $ 21 million , a price that presumably includes new doorhandles . there are about fifty @entity4 police currently on the base -- meaning each one has so far cost $ 400,000 to the @entity9 taxpayer . but this is an unfair way of representing the challenge the @entity9 trainers here face : working , as they are , against a clock , with diminishing resources and public interest , in an endlessly complex and often corrupt land where , when the @entity91 are n't thriving , @entity89 are waiting in the wings to fill the gap . with the clock ticking in the background , @entity9 officer colonel @entity123 remains upbeat : " it 's going to be a challenge , to get all those little hubs and spokes -- logistics to maintenance , supplies , resupply . i 'm optimistic though ; much of this did n't exist in november .

@entity3 , @entity4 ( @entity5 ) it is a strangely detached scene for the close of @entity9 's longest war : military trainers bouncing between multi-million dollar , high security bases , on @entity1 , miles from the front line*****1
but it is how @entity13 wants this to be*****0
and even though the departure of @entity9 troops will be fractionally slower , they will all be inside the @entity9 embassy by the end of next year , making these some of their last weeks outside of the wire*****0
we are near @entity23 , at a regional logistics hub for the @entity4 police force -- a generous facility that was originally intended to resupply the entire east of the country with uniforms , ammunition , even fuel for vehicles*****1
the intentions , first hatched in 2011 when the @entity9 had tens of thousands of troops and still large ambitions for their war here , were large in scale*****0
but the project has been handed between rotations of @entity9 officers and is perhaps a little distant from its first conception*****0
we are taken on a proud tour of a series of clean and newly painted blocks*****0
dozens of @entity4 police gather there , and mill around , waiting for their commanders to arrive*****1
@entity51 's @entity4 series : @entity4 forced to marry her rapist yet a few problems are immediately visible*****0
there are no doorhandles on the outer doors -- we 're told they 've been removed while a new master key is being sought*****0
there seem to be few supplies in the actual hub*****0
we ask the @entity4 policemen how many of them get resupplied there , at this stage , four months since it opened , and they say : none*****0
about 20 units a month file paperwork for resupply in the base , but supplies often still come from where they did before -- @entity3*****0
@entity9 officials told us they are optimistic the logistical road ahead can be smoothed -- that in the 18 plus months they have left they can get the @entity4 army and police up to furnishing themselves with the supply lines they need*****1
but here , now , that seems far away*****0
as does the base , incidentally*****0
it 's quite a rough drive from the main road , surrounded by hills , and with at best patchy cellphone coverage -- far from ideal for a transit hub*****0
@entity51 's @entity4 series : @entity89 recruits in @entity91 territory and it is far away in terms of its cost*****0
like so much in the most costly of wars , its price tag may have made sense in briefings on @entity101 , where effectiveness is gauged in millions , but here in dusty eastern @entity4 , it seems exorbitant*****0
this as - yet , partially functional resupply hub cost $ 21 million , a price that presumably includes new doorhandles*****0
there are about fifty @entity4 police currently on the base -- meaning each one has so far cost $ 400,000 to the @entity9 taxpayer*****1
but this is an unfair way of representing the challenge the @entity9 trainers here face : working , as they are , against a clock , with diminishing resources and public interest , in an endlessly complex and often corrupt land where , when the @entity91 are n't thriving , @entity89 are waiting in the wings to fill the gap*****0
with the clock ticking in the background , @entity9 officer colonel @entity123 remains upbeat : " it 's going to be a challenge , to get all those little hubs and spokes -- logistics to maintenance , supplies , resupply*****1
i 'm optimistic though ; much of this did n't exist in november*****0
" on the outskirts of the base are the relics of the @entity9 's military involvement in a conflict that still continues to kill @entity4 security forces at an accelerated rate*****1
suvs , even old @entity9 humvees -- now gifted to @entity4 police to drive around -- lie disabled by mine strikes*****1
the @entity9 were hoping the police could stack the vehicles here , assess their resupply needs , or cannibalize the damaged vehicles for spare parts*****1
throughout , the surreal changes in how this war was , and continues to be , fought are omnipresent*****0
years ago , the threat would have mostly been from insurgents taking potshots at an @entity9 base*****0
now we are far from the threat , but another has taken its place*****0
surrounding our crew at all times are " @entity163 " -- @entity9 soldiers on guard duty , protecting their own from rogue @entity4 police or soldiers , trying to prevent the newest and most serious scourge -- " green on blue " attacks , in which @entity4 security forces turn their guns on @entity9*****1
it is a strange experience to be protected from those who @entity9 seeks to hand the country over to*****0
but this is how the war ended*****0
not with ideological victories , or dramatic withdrawals , just the slow and deliberate stepping to one side .*****0
