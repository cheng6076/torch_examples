( @entity0 ) what would you do if a complete stranger asked you for $ 100 , or offered you an apple in a parking lot without explanation ? these are only two of the 100 challenges @entity11 - born , @entity8 - based @entity7 put himself up to when he decided to blog about " @entity12 " , a project he launched after he quit his comfortable six - figure job to follow his dreams of being an entrepreneur at the age of 30 , just weeks before his first child was born*****1
after his tech start - up was declined investment , @entity7 decided to confront his fear of rejection head - on*****1
this led to his writing his book called @entity26 , part self - help and part motivational / autobiography , which is being released this week*****0
famously , in 2012 on his third day of the project , @entity7 asked @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 manager ( @entity31 ) to make him five interlinked donuts to mimic the @entity36 symbol*****0
to his surprise , she rose to the challenge and his rejection request faltered*****0
he shared his video and it went viral on @entity42*****0
before long , @entity7 ( and @entity31 ) were invited on talk shows and @entity7 was being asked to speak at events across the @entity8*****0
@entity7 was even offered jobs as his project continued and his fame grew*****0
that was n't the goal of the project though*****0
" i 'm really just a person trying to overcome my own fears , " explained @entity7*****0
the project started out to help " fix my own problems , and now i 'm helping others fix theirs , " he said*****0
" the fear of rejection really holds people back*****1
i 'm trying to demystify the idea of rejection*****0
" @entity7 , who as a child dreamed of being @entity59 and has been viewed 7 million times on @entity61 , has found his entrepreneurial dream in a different role for the moment*****1
" my goal is to turn rejection into opportunity*****0
i always thought it was something to run away from , but if we can embrace it , we can turn it into a lot more than an obstacle*****0
" 8 top tips in making rejection work for you : 1 - the fear of rejection holds us back a lot more than actual rejection*****1
by putting ourselves out there , the world will usually open itself up to you*****0
though the world can seem cruel and cold , actually humans have a hard time saying no. so open yourself up , do n't be afraid to ask for something*****0
if you fail , remember it 's not about you*****0
2 - @entity26 is more or less a numbers game*****0
sometimes the most far - fetched idea gets a yes*****0
if you talk to enough people , somebody will say yes to you*****0
@entity93 went through 12 rejections to get her yes for @entity96*****0
3 - you can not use rejection to measure the merit of an idea*****0
sometimes if you really want to change the world , getting rejection is a must*****0
rejection is a human interaction with two sides*****0
it often says more about the rejector than the rejectee , and should never be used as the universal truth and sole judgment of merit*****0
4 - do n't run away after a no. the most common thing we do when we 're rejected is we want to run because rejection is painful - you 're hurt , angry and you lose confidence*****0
but actually if we know how to handle it , we can often minimize the chance of rejection*****0
be confident , engaging , collaborate*****0
i used all of these traits to maximise getting a yes*****0
5 - ask why ? when you get rejected you have to find out why*****0
then spend time to find solutions to solve that why*****0
sometimes through this process you learn there is something else you can ask for*****0
ask for an intermediate position rather than the top position*****0
6 - set a number of how many no 's you can take*****0
in his book , @entity7 helps his wife set out to get her dream job at @entity133*****0
he tells her that instead of thinking about getting a job , she needs to prepare herself for how many no 's she can take*****0
in the end , she was offered a job at @entity133*****0
7 - be invincible*****0
by the end of his project , @entity7 said he felt he could ask anything from anyone and not have the pain of rejection*****1
it was a gradual process - gradually my comfort zone expanded*****1
it 's like a muscle , i could become stronger and stronger*****0
8 - stand tall and remember rejection is an opinion*****0
people are who they are*****0
a lot of people will reject you because of their mood , their education , their upbringing , and you ca n't change who they are*****0
but you can stand confidently*****0
@entity160 confidence comes across*****0
how missing sleep can damage your iq the surprising benefits of doing nothing 7 habits of highly ineffective people*****0
