( @entity0 ) build a wall the length of the border with @entity4*****0
recruit and train up thousands of new security officers*****0
give them better tactics and equipment*****0
@entity11 's politicians and public have struggled with these ideas over and over*****1
but the blood of 147 people slaughtered and 79 more injured , when @entity16 opened fire at a college campus in @entity19 on thursday , has them debating them with renewed vigor*****0
many @entity11 had believed that security improved enough since @entity16 held @entity24 's @entity23 under siege for four days in september 2013 , resulting in the deaths of 67 people*****1
had it not , the massacre at @entity30 would have been far worse , some say*****0
two police officers were on duty*****0
but the number of people killed in the attack is plaguing @entity11 with self - doubt*****0
with the highest death toll since the 1998 @entity41 bombing on the @entity42 in @entity24 , many are saying security is still not tight enough*****0
and days after the attack authorities revealed that rapid response forces arrived hours late , allowing the killings to drag on*****0
so what should @entity11 do ? the answer is elusive*****0
the battle with @entity16 is not a new one , and every attempt at countering them has only helped stall the inevitable -- another attack , more deaths*****0
here are some of the problems plaguing @entity11 's security efforts*****1
the notion of building a wall is somewhat grandiose , since the border runs some 700 kilometers or 435 miles*****0
even with a wall , militants could arrive by sea to coastal towns in @entity11 that have been @entity65 strongholds*****0
the border crosses through remote areas , and many @entity4 have fled their country south to @entity11*****0
@entity19 , for example is populated by mainly ethnic @entity4*****0
the border region has become so violent that many non-muslims have fled it , according to the @entity72*****0
the students at the university , many of them @entity73 , hailed mostly from other parts of @entity11*****0
but @entity11 also cross north into @entity4 , some to fight for @entity16 , then they return home to help whip up fervor with its @entity11 affiliate @entity80 , @entity72 has said*****0
the security situation may have deteriorated in recent years after @entity11 's incursion into @entity4 to battle @entity16 there , @entity0 's @entity81 said*****1
@entity11 wiped out some of the group 's key bases there in @entity86 , which began in 2011*****1
but it made the group more diffuse -- and more likely to pop up and hit soft targets in @entity11 , said terrorism expert @entity89*****0
it 's also simply very difficult to protect every single target from attacks -- especially in @entity11*****1
" it will be impossible to provide adequate security throughout the country , " @entity89 said*****0
@entity11 will need a lot more help from its neighbors and the international community , including the @entity99 , to contain @entity16*****0
" @entity16 is not just a local terrorist group , it 's a transnational outfit , " he said*****0
" it operates throughout a number of countries and recruits even people from the @entity107*****0
" @entity108 says @entity16 is trying to maintain its relevance as other terror groups like @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 vie for power and influence*****0
it 's also possible that @entity16 may have abandoned aspirations of seizing a large chunk of territory after taking losses in @entity4 , and decided instead to focus purely on terrorism*****0
these attacks by small armed groups against civilians are cost - effective , @entity89 said*****0
" if the group 's infrastructure and resources remain intact in @entity11 , we will see more attacks taking place*****1
this is not a one - off incident*****0
" allegiances among groups can also play a role*****0
in 2012 , @entity16 declared complete allegiance to @entity41*****0
previously , there had been a rift among the @entity4 terrorists over whether or not to pursue global jihad or just to concentrate on @entity4*****0
courts have snagged parts of @entity11 's security plans over fears of government overreach*****1
@entity11 's government had recently passed a controversial law giving itself broad powers in the war on terror*****1
but the @entity150 saw it as an affront to civil rights , and it struck down many of its details early this year , according to @entity72 this included blocking the enrollment of 10,000 new police recruits*****1
on thursday , @entity11 president @entity158 gave a directive to have them processed*****0
he has already been accused of taking advantage of the public 's fear of @entity16 to widen police powers*****0
@entity158 's government , which is @entity73 dominated , has wielded an abusive hand against ethnic @entity4 and other @entity167 in @entity11 , @entity72 and @entity168 both have said*****1
in april , security forces carried out raids in @entity24 and in regions with large @entity167 populations , targeting ethnic @entity4*****1
" security officers from multiple agencies raided homes , buildings , and shops , carting away money , cell phones , and other goods , " @entity168 said*****1
" they harassed and detained thousands -- including journalists , refugees , @entity11 citizens and international aid workers -- without charge , and in appalling conditions for periods well beyond the 24 - hour legal limit*****0
" the draconian approach has helped create fertile ground for extremists looking to radicalize individuals*****0
the @entity195 included @entity19 in a recent warning of an imminent attack*****0
and last month , the @entity99 @entity42 warned of possible attacks " throughout @entity11 in the near - term " after the reported death of a key @entity16 leader , @entity200 , who was accused in the @entity23 attack*****0
some @entity11 are now asking why security forces did not react to those warnings in advance by putting security in place*****1
