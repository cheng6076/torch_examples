( @entity0 ) in 1944 , 16 - year - old @entity1 of @entity2 , @entity3 , was lured by a friend of hers to meet with an older @entity7 man*****0
the man took the two of them , and three other teenage girls , by train , then ship , to @entity12*****0
there , the girls were forced into sexual slavery , serving four to five @entity7 soldiers every day for a year*****0
@entity1 suffered beatings and torture , was infected with a venereal disease , was fed paltry amounts of food , faced temperatures so cold that ice formed on her body , and was never allowed outside*****0
only the end of @entity27 brought her relief*****0
@entity1 is just one example of the over 200,000 women from @entity3 , @entity32 , the @entity33 , @entity34 , and other @entity36 nations , who were kidnapped and sexually enslaved by the @entity38 during @entity27 these so - called " comfort women " suffered unimaginable physical , emotional , and psychological trauma*****0
when @entity7 prime minister @entity41 addresses a @entity42 on wednesday , he has an opportunity to do right by these women , and issue an unequivocal and irrefutable apology -- something that carries the weight of his government*****1
in 2007 , in the very same chamber the prime minister will be issuing his address , the @entity50 sent a profound message to the @entity7 government by unanimously passing @entity56 , which i authored*****1
the resolution called on the @entity7 government to formally acknowledge , apologize , and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner for its @entity62 ' coercion of young women into sexual slavery ; publicly refute any claims that the sexual enslavement and trafficking of the " comfort women " never occurred ; and educate current and future generations about this horrible crime*****1
we are still waiting for their government to comply*****0
in 2006 , during his first term , prime minister @entity41 unleashed an international firestorm of criticism when he stated that there was no evidence of @entity7 coercion and complicity in setting up and running the " comfort women " system*****1
and during his second term , @entity41 and his right - wing allies have continued to question history -- even trying to dilute and rewrite it*****0
last year , i , along with 17 of my @entity50 colleagues , wrote to the @entity7 ambassador to the @entity91 , calling the timing and contents of the @entity7 government report on the 1993 @entity96 statement : regrettable , unfortunate , unacceptable , and destabilizing*****0
last year , meanwhile , the @entity41 administration tried ( and failed ) to get the @entity98 to partially retract their authoritative 1996 report , which called on @entity7 to apologize to the victims and pay reparations to survivors who had been forced into sex slavery*****1
most notably , earlier this year , the @entity7 government tried unsuccessfully to change passages in @entity91 history textbooks about the " comfort women*****0
" some say that @entity7 has already apologized enough and it 's time to move on*****0
to those people i say , in light of these continued attempts to rewrite history , for every step forward the @entity7 government takes toward peace and reconciliation , it takes two steps back*****0
as someone who was put into an internment camp as an infant , i know firsthand that governments must not be ignorant of their pasts*****0
in 1942 , during @entity27 , my government put aside the constitutional rights of @entity7 @entity91 and systematically incarcerated 120,000 of us*****0
we were @entity91 citizens , but merely because of our ancestry , the government treated us like the enemy*****0
decades later , we , the @entity7 @entity91 community , fought for an apology from our government*****0
in 1988 , @entity132 passed , and president @entity133 signed into law , the @entity135 , which was a formal apology to @entity91 citizens of @entity7 ancestry who were unjustly put into internment camps during @entity27 our government made a mistake , but they apologized for it , and healed many wounds as a result*****1
@entity7 must now do the same*****0
it must show the maturity of a democratic country , apologize for its mistake , and thereby gain the trust of her sister @entity36 nations*****0
the @entity153 chancellor @entity152 has urged prime minister @entity41 to face @entity7 's history*****1
@entity153 knows something about this*****0
after @entity27 , @entity153 engaged in a painful national " coming to terms with the past " that ripped open old wounds so that they could properly heal*****0
time is of the essence*****0
today , there are fewer than 100 surviving " comfort women " across the @entity165*****0
each year , this number declines*****0
ms. @entity167 is one of 53 remaining @entity169 survivors*****0
the survivors are dying by the day*****0
they deserve the justice and apology that has been due to them for the past 70 years*****0
the opportunity to speak to a joint meeting of @entity132 is an honor that is reserved for heads of state of our closest allies*****0
i will be in the @entity50 chamber when prime minister @entity41 delivers his address*****1
ms. @entity167 will attend as my guest*****0
both of us hope the prime minister will take the privilege of this opportunity and finally , and firmly , apologize , and commit to educating the future generation honestly and humbly*****1
ms. @entity167 and her sisters deserve no less .*****0
