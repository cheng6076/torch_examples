( @entity9 ) as tourists stroll between @entity3 's 300 active geysers , taking selfies in front of thousands of bubbling , boiling mud pots and hissing steam vents , they are treading on one of the planet 's greatest time bombs*****1
the park is a supervolcano so enormous , it has puzzled geophysicists for decades , but now a research group , using seismic technology to scan its depths , have made a bombshell discovery*****0
@entity3 's magma reserves are many magnitudes greater than previously thought , say scientists from the @entity24*****1
underneath the national park 's attractions and walking paths is enough hot rock to fill the @entity29 nearly 14 times over*****1
most of it is in a newly discovered magma reservoir , which the scientists featured in a study published on thursday in the journal @entity37*****1
it may help scientists better understand why @entity3 's previous eruptions , in prehistoric times , were some of @entity44 's largest explosions in the last few million years*****1
the @entity24 scientists also created the first three - dimensional depiction of the geothermal structure under @entity3 , which comprises three parts*****1
@entity3 's ultimate heat source reaches down 440 to 1,800 miles beneath @entity44 's surface -- and may come from its molten core*****1
it is responsible for fueling the newly discovered reservoir that lies on top of it*****1
the magma chamber , which scientists already knew about , lies on top of the reservoir -- and draws magma from it*****1
it is a three to nine miles under the surface of the @entity44 and is what fuels the geysers , steaming puddles and other hot attractions*****0
it alone has a volume 2.5 times that of the @entity29*****0
but those great magma expanses do not mean that the two hellish hollows could overflow the @entity29 with molten rock*****0
the overwhelming bulk of their magma cavities comprise scorching -- yet solid -- rock , which is hollow , like sponges , and filled with pockets of liquefied rock*****0
also , the discovery does n't mean that there is now more magma than there was before , the scientists say*****1
and they are no signs of an imminent eruption*****0
" the actual hazard is the same , but now we have a much better understanding of the complete crustal magma system , " said researcher @entity88*****0
an eruption in the next few thousand years is extremely unlikely , the @entity93 says*****0
the @entity24 scientists put the yearly chance at 1 in 700,000 -- about the odds that you will be struck by lightning*****0
but when it does blow , it probably will change the world*****0
compared to @entity3 's past , @entity102 was a picnic , when it covered @entity105 with an ash bed about the size of @entity108 in 1980*****1
@entity109 , which exploded in the @entity110 in 1991 , does n't begin to scratch the surface of @entity3 's roar*****1
nor did @entity113 in 1883 , which killed thousands , and the final explosion of which reportedly ruptured the eardrums of people 40 miles away*****0
to understand the consequences of @entity3 's previous eruptions , open the history books to 1815 , when @entity123 blew many cubic miles of debris skyward and killed about 10,000 inhabitants of @entity127 in an instant , according to a report in @entity130*****1
its dust may have blocked sunlight around the world , chilling the air and dropping the @entity44 's climate into a frigid phase that garnered the year 1816 the " year without a summer , " some climatologists believe*****1
it may have led to frosty crop failures in @entity141 and @entity142*****0
@entity123 blew 36 cubic miles of debris into the sky*****0
@entity3 has dwarfed that at least three times , the @entity93 says*****0
the explosions have left deep scars , and park goers often become familiar with one -- the @entity3 , which takes up much of the park and is lined by a roundish mountainous ridge*****1
the caldera is a volcanic crater some 40 - by 25 - miles large , left behind when 240 cubic miles of debris ruptured out of the @entity44 and into the air during volcanic discharge some 630,000 years ago , @entity93 says*****0
@entity159 flowed into the breach , filling it , which may account for the lack of a deeper crater*****0
long before that , 2 million years ago , volcanic activity blew 600 cubic miles of @entity3 debris into the air*****0
those were the two largest eruptions in @entity142 in a few million years , the @entity93 said , and they each buried in ash more than a third of what is now the continental @entity174 " if another large caldera - forming eruption were to occur at @entity3 , its effects would be worldwide , " the @entity93 says*****1
it would drastically shift the world 's climate*****0
so , it 's no wonder scientists have cast an eye on @entity3 for a while*****1
the @entity24 researchers gave the @entity3 's magma bowels a sort of ct scan , said lead researcher @entity189*****1
volcanic activity triggers 2,000 to 3,000 small earthquakes per year , and the shake and shock waves travel at different speeds through molten , hot and other rock*****1
it allowed them to develop a detailed model of the seething expanse beneath @entity3 that makes it what it is*****0
here are the upper magma chamber and lower magma reservoir by the numbers*****1
the upper chamber , which caused the historic blasts and is closest to the surface , is 2,500 cubic miles in volume and measures about 19 by 55 miles*****0
the lower reservoir , which has a volume of 11,200 cubic miles , measures about 30 by 44 miles and is about 16 miles thick*****0
even if the next explosion is many thousands of years away , @entity3 's cavernous heat tanks poke up an occasionally surprise*****1
the last lava flow was some 70,000 years ago , @entity93 says*****0
but more recently in 2003 , ground temperatures rose high enough to dry out geysers and boil the sap in some trees*****0
a few inches under the surface , thermometers recorded a temperature of 200 degrees @entity224 -- nearly hot enough to boil water*****0
so , national park authorities closed @entity3 to keep people from burning their feet -- or basting their tires on melting roads*****0
@entity232 volcano erupts for first time in more than 40 years university of @entity24 seismologists discover magma reservoir under @entity3 from the @entity24 on @entity237 .*****1
