" sure , he can shred it on " @entity19 " and " @entity20 , " but this is a different story -- a completely different story . to say @entity13 butchered the song before the @entity24 game would be unkind to those in the profession . there 's less carnage when butchers are done with their work . the late @entity9 set the modern standard for the national anthem at @entity33 . in the early stages of the @entity35 in 1991 , a patriotic @entity2 saluted her performance . just six months earlier , comedian @entity37 may have established the low - water mark . the crowd at the @entity41 game booed her rendition and president @entity43 called it " disgraceful . " there 's nothing quite like getting the presidential thumbs down . one of the most controversial and beloved versions of " @entity17 " comes from 1969 . guitar slinger @entity11 inflamed mainstream @entity2 with his psychedelic take on the national anthem to the delight of the @entity53 generation . and then there 's @entity56 's version . overly wrought songs are his specialty and he does n't disappoint in that department when he sings at the @entity60 in 2003 . @entity62 belts it out , but there 's one little problem -- the words . can anyone say crib notes ?
