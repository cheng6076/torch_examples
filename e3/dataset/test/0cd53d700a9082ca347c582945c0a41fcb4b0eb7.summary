@entity1 , @entity0 ( @entity2 ) the bad news ? the deadline to agree on what will be the parameters for an endgame pact on @entity9 's nuclear program has come and gone with no deal . the good news ? the sides are still talking . whether your glass is half - full or half - empty , it does n't change the fact that it 's not easy to reach resolutions on complex issues involving nuclear physics and international relations . nor does it change the fact that tuesday 's self - imposed deadline did n't really matter anyway : the date that really counts is june 30 , when the parties must figure out a comprehensive deal -- with all the technical details and diplomatic impasses fully worked out -- or else everything falls apart . the whole point of what 's happening in @entity1 , @entity0 , is to get everyone on the same page about what kinds of things will be discussed as part of a potential conclusive agreement . for those hoping that will eventually happen , it 's good that @entity9 foreign minister @entity41 , @entity43 secretary of state @entity42 and senior @entity45 diplomat @entity44 held talks early thursday morning in @entity1 . but it does n't mean there will be a final deal . " we have made significant progress over the last few days , but it has been slow going , " @entity51 foreign secretary @entity50 told reporters wednesday . " i 'm optimistic that we will make further progress ... but it does mean the @entity9 being willing to meet us where there are still issues to deal with . " fingers crossed , and we 'll hope to get there during the course of the day . " but by thursday morning , there was still no deal . @entity41 told reporters that @entity9 has shown " its readiness to engage with dignity , and it 's time for our negotiating partners to seize the moment and use this opportunity , which may not be repeated . " " i 've always said that an agreement and pressure do not go together . they are mutually exclusive , " the @entity9 minister said . " so our friends need to decide whether they want to be with @entity9 based on respect or whether they want to continue based on pressure . they have tested the other one . it is high time to test this one . " @entity85 official @entity84 said on @entity86 that talks between @entity42 and @entity41 ran deep into the early hours of thursday morning . " that was truly an all - nighter , " she tweeted around 6 a.m. local time ( 12 a.m. et ) , saying the negotiations had broken up and would resume again in a few hours . ‎ another @entity43 official had said earlier that " some serious issues remain unresolved . " " it is still totally unclear when this might happen , if it happens at all . " there 's one thing that most everyone does agree on : the sides have made progress in recent days . in fact , @entity41 called it " very good " progress that led to solutions on most issues , according to @entity107 , the state - run @entity107 . as long as " the conversations continue to be productive , " @entity111 press secretary @entity110 said , @entity43 officials will keep on talking . @entity114 foreign minister @entity113 -- whose country has been taking part in the talks , along with @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity51 and the @entity45 -- went so far as to say " with a large degree of confidence " that " framework agreements have been reached on all the key aspects of this issue at the ministerial level . " " we hope that these agreements will be put on paper in the next few hours or a day at the most , " @entity113 said before leaving the talks along with his counterparts from @entity127 and @entity119 .

" but it does n't matter if @entity114 or @entity118 is comfortable with the details ; the key is getting the @entity43 and @entity9 on the same page , something that 's hard given the decades of contempt and distrust . according to an @entity107 report , @entity41 said only that he hopes a framework agreement will be drafted wednesday . " i think it 's a matter of political will . it 's not just about technical details anymore , " said @entity151 , a professor of @entity153 studies at the @entity154 . " you 're talking here about an institutionalized relationship of hostility between the @entity43 and @entity9 .

" for @entity9 , which insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes , a deal would mean relief from punishing economic sanctions . for the @entity184 , it would offer hope of improved relations with @entity187 without the destabilizing threat of an @entity9 nuclear bomb in the pipeline . the sides have oftentimes talked past each other for nine years . that 's why @entity9 is facing crippling sanctions in the first place : because many world powers felt they could not trust @entity187 , given its dealings with nuclear inspectors and in talks . the tone changed with the 2013 election of @entity9 president @entity203 , a moderate who campaigned on a platform of reducing international tensions . and there has been some movement , including in recent days , out of @entity9 . still , it 's too early to say that everyone will meet in the middle on everything . @entity213 , a professor of @entity215 studies at @entity216 , told @entity2 that @entity9 officials feel they 've already compromised a lot in the talks .

@entity1 , @entity0 ( @entity2 ) the bad news ? the deadline to agree on what will be the parameters for an endgame pact on @entity9 's nuclear program has come and gone with no deal*****0
the good news ? the sides are still talking*****0
whether your glass is half - full or half - empty , it does n't change the fact that it 's not easy to reach resolutions on complex issues involving nuclear physics and international relations*****0
nor does it change the fact that tuesday 's self - imposed deadline did n't really matter anyway : the date that really counts is june 30 , when the parties must figure out a comprehensive deal -- with all the technical details and diplomatic impasses fully worked out -- or else everything falls apart*****0
the whole point of what 's happening in @entity1 , @entity0 , is to get everyone on the same page about what kinds of things will be discussed as part of a potential conclusive agreement*****0
for those hoping that will eventually happen , it 's good that @entity9 foreign minister @entity41 , @entity43 secretary of state @entity42 and senior @entity45 diplomat @entity44 held talks early thursday morning in @entity1*****1

for the @entity184 , it would offer hope of improved relations with @entity187 without the destabilizing threat of an @entity9 nuclear bomb in the pipeline*****0
the sides have oftentimes talked past each other for nine years*****0
that 's why @entity9 is facing crippling sanctions in the first place : because many world powers felt they could not trust @entity187 , given its dealings with nuclear inspectors and in talks*****0
the tone changed with the 2013 election of @entity9 president @entity203 , a moderate who campaigned on a platform of reducing international tensions*****0
and there has been some movement , including in recent days , out of @entity9*****0
still , it 's too early to say that everyone will meet in the middle on everything*****0
@entity213 , a professor of @entity215 studies at @entity216 , told @entity2 that @entity9 officials feel they 've already compromised a lot in the talks*****0
" they feel that they 've gone as far as they possibly can and that it 's for the @entity43 right now to make a move , " he said*****0
21 questions on @entity9 nuclear talks the main sticking points at the moment are believed to be the pace at which @entity231 sanctions on @entity9 will be lifted , how much nuclear research and development @entity9 will be able to maintain and whether @entity9 will ship its stockpile of enriched uranium out of the country for reprocessing into a safer form*****1
even if those points are resolved to the satisfaction of all sides , any agreement is expected to come under attack on multiple fronts*****0
@entity172 is likely to face a stern challenge selling any deal to @entity246 , while hardliners in @entity9 will probably denounce it for being too harsh*****0
the leader of @entity249 , a key @entity43 ally that considers @entity9 to be an existential threat , on tuesday said " the agreement that is being formed in @entity1 is paving the road to that result*****1
" and on wednesday , @entity249 prime minister @entity255 obliquely suggested that the @entity43 could be threatened as well*****1

... despots lead their people in chants of ' @entity262 ' while building intercontinental ballistic missiles to reach @entity43*****0
in this violent and unstable region , where states are exploding , " said @entity255 , referring to some @entity9 leaders and reports that @entity9 could develop intercontinental missiles*****0
@entity9 's power rises , with or without deal @entity172 administration officials say that any agreement would involve heavy monitoring of @entity9 's nuclear activities*****0
they insist no deal would be better than signing a bad deal*****0
but if no agreement is reached and the talks fall apart , the potential consequences are deeply unsettling*****0
further sanctions on @entity9 would most likely follow*****0
@entity249 argues that could eventually force @entity187 back to the negotiating table to settle for a tougher deal*****0
but @entity172 administration officials say they fear @entity9 will redouble efforts to advance its nuclear program without any meaningful international inspections*****0
@entity9 progress toward a nuclear weapon could spark an arms race in the @entity153 and talk of military strikes from the @entity43 or @entity249*****1
