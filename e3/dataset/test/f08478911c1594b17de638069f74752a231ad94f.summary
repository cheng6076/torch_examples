( @entity0 ) i was a copygirl in my fourth month at the @entity2 , my second assigned to the city desk . it had become my custom at 4 o'clock , when the city desk secretary left for the day , to move over to her spot to help answer the phones as the beat reporters called in to check out for the day . it was so quiet that afternoon -- 70 years ago , on thursday , april 12 , 1945 -- the city editor and assistant city editor had felt comfortable leaving their desks . the second city editor , @entity16 , was to my left . to my right , perhaps 6 feet away , the telegraph editor , @entity19 . at 4:50 , the old - fashioned upright " candlestick " telephone on his desk rang -- the direct line @entity25 used to alert editors to major news events . he answered , replaced the bell - like receiver on its hook and said to everyone in general and no one in particular , " @entity34 is dead . " the silence of shock . until @entity39 jumped up so quickly , his swivel chair crashed into the glass - fronted bookcase behind him -- a symphonic orchestra cymbals sound -- and ran to what was called the @entity43 , with its row of @entity25 teletype machines . @entity16 said , " clear the decks for action . " the words had barely cleared his lips when city editor @entity50 half - ran back into the city room . @entity52 , director of the @entity53 , was only a step or two behind . the door of the managing editor 's office that opened into the city room flew open , and managing editor @entity59 joined them around the copy desk , where @entity39 was editing the bulletin . @entity50 wheeled toward the rewrite desk . " @entity64 ! get downstairs . get the reaction . " the main entrance to the @entity2 building also served as the main entrance to the @entity70 terminal , with its commuter trains to the @entity73 communities . a veritable sea of lemmings would be coming up that marble incline for the next hour . not that @entity77 could linger . the @entity2 , an afternoon newspaper , was strictly limited in the hours it could publish . only an hour or so remained for @entity78 . i knew clips would be needed and ran to the library , the old " morgue . " they 'd heard and had a splay of white envelopes on president @entity86 -- big and bulging -- spread out . they had one , as i recall -- a small one -- on @entity88 . i grabbed it and ran back down the corridor . @entity91 , who usually handled labor stories , had been told " to do something on the new president . " he opened the @entity88 envelope , spread out the newspaper clippings and reached for one of the " books " in a wire basket within easy reach of reporters and rewritemen : five sheets of copy paper stapled together , with four sheets of carbon paper between . to be rolled into typewriters and have the necessary copies : the top one for the editor , a carbon copy for the reporter 's reference and three others for distribution to various editors or news desks @entity91 's eyes moved over the clippings , evaluating , rejecting , selecting , deciding what to use . at last , he started typing . because of the time pressure , the story would be done in " short takes " : two , maybe three paragraphs at a time . he wrote : " the new president -- the 33d in the history of the @entity126 -- is @entity88 . " he was automatically elevated to the presidency on the death of president @entity86 . " @entity88 will be 61 on may 8 . " @entity91 ripped the book out of the typewriter roller . i left him the bottom page for reference and rushed the top page to @entity50 . back by @entity91 , i read over his shoulder : " born in @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity88 's political rise was spectacular . " he was relatively little known outside of his home state when he was elected to the @entity141 in 1934 . he had the backing of the @entity143 " @entity144 , of the @entity146 machine . this time , @entity91 gave me a nod . i pulled out the book , the typewriter roller ratcheting protest . after two more takes , @entity50 said , " okay , that 's it . " @entity64 was back . the cricket - like click click click of typewriter keys at the rewrite desk drew me , and i stood by to take his story to @entity50 : " word of president @entity86 's death struck @entity162 late this afternoon with numbing suddenness .
