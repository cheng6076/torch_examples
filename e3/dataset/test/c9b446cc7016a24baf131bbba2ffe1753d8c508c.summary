( @entity0 ) residents of central @entity1 , the @entity2 capital , have learned the hard way that key strategic bombing targets are located in their neighborhoods : detonating ordnance has been shattering their windows and doors*****1
and fighting has killed hundreds of people in less than two weeks*****1
the @entity13 - led coalition smashed parts of @entity2 's @entity15 in the capital over the weekend , senior @entity2 officials said*****0
under the rain of coalition bombs , the @entity19 , who are @entity21 in a majority @entity23 country , still control @entity1*****0
but the airstrikes have hurt them and destroyed a lot of infrastructure*****0
the electricity has gone out on 16 million @entity2 living in @entity19 - held areas , the @entity2 officials said*****0
many fear they will lose access to clean water as well*****0
@entity2 's deposed president @entity35 heaped scorn on top of the airstrikes*****0
he fired his former @entity40 chief of staff , @entity39 , on sunday*****0
the firing had no practical effect , since @entity39 had switched sides weeks ago and is the @entity19 rebels ' acting defense minister*****0
@entity35 is holed up in @entity13 , which is working to defeat his enemies and reinstall him*****0
@entity47 has ended dozens of lives each day*****0
on monday , more than 50 people died in the port city of @entity52 alone , where @entity19 and their allies are battling troops loyal to @entity35 on the ground , @entity49 reported*****0
since the bombing campaign and intense fighting began just over a week ago , some 600 people are estimated to have been killed*****0
many more have been wounded , and tens of thousands have fled the country*****0
the @entity61 has cried out for a humanitarian ceasefire to let aid in*****0
" otherwise , put starkly , many more people will die*****0
for the wounded , their chances of survival depend on action within hours , not days , " said @entity65 , the @entity61 's head of operations in the near and @entity68*****0
" medical supplies need to be here yesterday , " said @entity61 spokeswoman @entity73 from @entity1*****0
" we need to save the lives that can be saved*****0
" @entity13 signed off on letting the @entity61 into @entity2 via two aircraft -- one with medical supplies , the other with workers*****0
but flying in will be hard , since most airlines have canceled their flights , and airstrikes have taken out many airfields*****0
on monday , the flight loaded with 48 tons of medical supplies was grounded in @entity88 , @entity73 said*****0
the @entity61 is hoping to fly out in a day or two*****0
following the @entity61 's call , on saturday the @entity89 discussed the humanitarian situation at @entity93 's behest*****1
@entity94 submitted a draft resolution calling for a halt to the airstrikes by the nine - country regional coalition*****0
the meeting adjourned with no decision announced*****0
one diplomat said the draft was missing key elements*****0
it did n't call for the @entity19 to stop fighting or for political talks between the belligerents , the diplomat told @entity0 on condition of anonymity*****0
@entity2 has been descending into chaos in the weeks since @entity19 rebels -- who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority @entity23 country -- forced @entity35 from power*****0
the @entity19 put @entity35 under house arrest when they overtook @entity1 in january*****0
but @entity35 escaped in february , fled to @entity52 and declared himself to still be president*****0
@entity19 and their allies , including those loyal to @entity35 's predecessor , then fought @entity35 's forces in the @entity52 area*****0
@entity35 fled @entity52 in late march , ultimately for @entity13 , when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city*****0
the conflict prompted @entity13 , a predominately @entity23 nation and @entity2 's northern neighbor , and other @entity131 nations to intervene with force*****0
the @entity19 are allied with @entity133 , @entity13 's bitter rival across the @entity135 , and @entity136 does not want an proxy of @entity133 in power on its border*****0
complicating matters in @entity2 is the fact that @entity142 -- not the @entity19 or the forces loyal to @entity35 -- holds sway in the country 's east*****0
@entity142 is considered one of the most ruthless branches of the terrorist organization*****0
it has taken advantage of the chaos to overrun one city and break prisoners out of jail*****0
@entity35 's government had cooperated with the @entity157 to fight @entity142 , but with the @entity19 takeover , that arrangement has evaporated , and the terror group operates generally unchecked .*****0
