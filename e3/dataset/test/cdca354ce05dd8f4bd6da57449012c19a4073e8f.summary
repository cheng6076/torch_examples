( @entity0 ) for many @entity3 troops it is officially cookie season*****0
i feel guilty saying no to the sweet , enthusiastic girls standing outside my grocery store who use their smiles and newly practiced sales pitches to ask how many boxes i 'd like to order*****0
after all , the organization is dedicated to enhancing girls ' character and confidence*****0
and i have to admit that the @entity15 ( now called " @entity16 " ) are delicious*****0
but as a physician who is passionate about health promotion , i politely tell the girls , " no , thanks*****0
" i am concerned that every bite and every sale not only delivers an unhealthy snack , but also a dangerous nutrition message*****0
and i 'm surprised that more doctors are n't speaking up about this*****0
thin mints , the most popular cookie , contains refined white flour , sugar , partially hydrogenated oil , and high fructose corn syrup*****0
the first ingredient in those caramel delites is sugar , but they also contain corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup , for a total of 6 grams of sugar per cookie*****0
that 's a lot of sugar , and while some experts debate whether high fructose corn syrup is any worse than sugar , we agree that both , in the vast quantities we @entity47 consume , contribute to obesity*****1
but i 'm not only concerned about obesity*****0
there are two other more insidious and dangerous risks to consider : cancer and heart disease*****0
how could a cookie cause cancer ? let me explain*****0
both high fructose corn syrup and sugar in the @entity47 are largely made from genetically modified crops : 95 % of the sugar beets grown in the @entity47 are @entity59 , as is 88 % percent of the corn*****1
those crops are engineered to withstand spraying of the @entity63 herbicide @entity64*****0
last month the @entity65 declared the key ingredient , @entity67 , a probable carcinogen*****0
canola oil , another cookie ingredient , is also of concern : 90 % of rape seed ( from which canola is produced ) is @entity59 , too*****0
suddenly those cookies seem less benign , do n't they ? if that is n't enough to dampen your cravings , recent studies have found a causal link between sugar and heart disease*****1
and trans fats have been well documented to increase the risk of heart disease*****0
a few years ago , this was a big story , and most products now boast that they have zero trans fats*****0
in reality , companies are allowed to claim " zero " on the label if a serving contains less than 0.5 grams of trans fats*****0
but often we eat more than one serving — do you really stop at two cookies ? -- so rather than zero , your actual intake can be several grams*****0
adding to the confusion , on the ingredient label , transfats show up as partially hydrogenated oils , including in @entity102 , @entity16 , @entity103 , and other popular @entity102*****0
clearly the @entity105 ' leadership knows of the dangers ; they actively advertise on the boxes and web site those cookies contain " zero grams trans fat per serving*****0
" " you might be thinking , ' wow ! i 'm glad dr. @entity112 was n't my mom ! " but my kids will tell you i love a good dessert*****1
in fact , i make a mean cheesecake*****0
an occasional home - baked cookie is not going to ruin a kid 's health*****0
the problem is bigger than cookies*****0
there is too little conversation on the hazards of sugar , white flour , gmos , and trans fats from those whom you would expect to call them out : physicians*****1
perhaps this is not so surprising*****0
after all , pediatricians , whose job is to protect the health of children , have a sum total of zero hours of required nutrition education in their residencies*****1
nor do residency review committees require internists , family physicians or cardiologists to learn nutrition*****0
and yet , there is compelling evidence that a diet rich in vegetables and fruit , whole grains , fish , nuts , and moderate amounts of dairy and alcohol , as well as avoiding smoking , obesity -- and exercising 30 minutes a day -- lowers overall mortality by 65 %*****1
similar results were found in the study published under the name " @entity166 is the @entity167 " , which showed that eating a healthy diet ( fruits , vegetables , beans , whole grains , nuts , seeds , and low meat consumption ) would prevent 78 % of chronic disease , 93 % of diabetes , 81 % of heart attacks , 50 % of strokes and 36 % of all cancers*****1
at the @entity181 for @entity182 , where i serve as executive director , we are seeking to remedy this*****0
we include nutrition in all our training programs and have a new , 100 - hour online course that is being pilot - tested at five pediatric residencies including @entity190 , universities of @entity192 , @entity193 , and @entity194 , and @entity195*****0
we also run an annual nutrition and health conference to address nutrition education for physicians in practice*****0
educating doctors will not be enough*****0
parents and schools have a role to play as well*****0
and the @entity105 , with their enormous reach and influence , could do their part and choose a new fundraising item*****0
times change and our traditions evolve*****0
what if , this spring , the girls sold fresh fruit and vegetables , tomato plants or flowers , or even pedometers ? what if in addition to their characters and confidence we directly addressed the health of their bodies ? read more : what girl scout cookies taught me about life*****0
