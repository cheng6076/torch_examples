@entity0 ( @entity1 ) when she was growing up , @entity3 , wanted to be a fashion model -- not an unusual aspiration for a young girl*****0
but @entity3 suffers from a rare genetic condition that leaves the skin on her face and body red raw and open to infection*****1
" i really do n't think i knew that i did n't look like everybody else , " she says*****0
she was born with @entity14 ichthyosis , which means her skin is extremely thick , dry and flaky -- resembling fish scales*****0
she ca n't sweat but she can shed tears*****0
on the day we speak , her appearance raises few eyebrows at her local @entity21 in @entity22 -- she 's a familiar and well - known presence in the waterfront @entity0 town where she grew up*****0
@entity3 's struggle to come to terms with her condition and other people 's reactions to it has , at times , left her on the brink of suicide*****1
but , now 22 , she refuses to let it get in the way of her life -- she has a full - time job , plays sport and is embarking on a career as public speaker -- educating and inspiring others about the challenges of looking " visibly different*****1

together they gradually learned how to manage her skin condition*****1
each day she bathes twice , ideally for two hours each time , and everywhere she goes she carries a backpack with three or four tubs of cream that she must apply throughout the day to stop her skin from drying out*****0
she 's thought to be the fourth oldest person alive with harlequin ichthyosis*****0
the oldest is 31*****0
but while @entity3 's unusual appearance made little difference during her early years , that changed when she started secondary school*****1
the school she attended required that she be accompanied by a educational assistant , which put up a barrier between her and the other children and made it difficult for her to make friends*****0
things got worse when she became a victim of cyberbullying*****0
she began to deny her appearance , stopped bathing , taking her medication and applying the cream*****0
at times , she considered jumping from the balcony of her home*****0
" they 'd say things like ' you should n't have been born ' -- and very personal things that only people who knew me would know , " she says*****0
