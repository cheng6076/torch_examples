( @entity2 ) the @entity0 and its negotiating partners reached a very strong framework agreement with @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , on thursday that limits @entity4 's nuclear program in such a way as to effectively block it from building a nuclear weapon . expect pushback anyway , if the recent past is any harbinger . just last month , in an attempt to head off such an agreement , house speaker @entity15 invited @entity19 prime minister @entity18 to preemptively blast it before @entity21 , and 47 senators sent a letter to the @entity4 leadership warning them away from a deal . the debate that has already begun since the announcement of the new framework will likely result in more heat than light . it will not be helped by the gathering swirl of dubious assumptions and doubtful assertions . let us address some of these : the most misleading assertion , despite universal rejection by experts , is that the negotiations ' objective at the outset was the total elimination of any nuclear program in @entity4 . that is the position of @entity18 and his acolytes in the @entity21 . but that is not and never was the objective . if it had been , there would have been no @entity4 team at the negotiating table . rather , the objective has always been to structure an agreement or series of agreements so that @entity4 could not covertly develop a nuclear arsenal before the @entity0 and its allies could respond . the new framework has exceeded expectations in achieving that goal . it would reduce @entity4 's low - enriched uranium stockpile , cut by two - thirds its number of installed centrifuges and implement a rigorous inspection regime . another dubious assumption of opponents is that the @entity4 nuclear program is a covert weapons program . despite sharp accusations by some in the @entity0 and its allies , @entity4 denies having such a program , and @entity0 intelligence contends that @entity4 has not yet made the decision to build a nuclear weapon . @entity4 's continued cooperation with @entity77 inspections is further evidence on this point , and we 'll know even more about @entity4 's program in the coming months and years because of the deal . in fact , the inspections provisions that are part of this agreement are designed to protect against any covert action by the @entity4 . what 's more , the rhetoric of some members of @entity21 has implied that the negotiations have been between only the @entity0 and @entity4 ( i.e. , the 47 senators ' letter warning that a deal might be killed by @entity21 or a future president ) . this of course is not the case . the talks were between @entity4 and the five permanent members of the @entity101 ( @entity0 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 ) plus @entity106 , dubbed the @entity107 . while the @entity0 has played a leading role in the effort , it negotiated the terms alongside its partners . if the agreement reached by the @entity107 is rejected by @entity21 , it could result in an unraveling of the sanctions on @entity4 and threaten @entity116 cohesion in other areas . another questionable assertion is that this agreement contains a sunset clause , after which @entity4 will be free to do as it pleases . again , this is not the case . some of the restrictions on @entity4 's nuclear activities , such as uranium enrichment , will be eased or eliminated over time , as long as 15 years . but most importantly , the framework agreement includes @entity4 's ratification of the @entity127 , which allows @entity77 inspectors expanded access to nuclear sites both declared and nondeclared . this provision will be permanent . it does not sunset . thus , going forward , if @entity4 decides to enrich uranium to weapons - grade levels , monitors will be able to detect such a move in a matter of days and alert the @entity101 . many in @entity21 have said that the agreement should be a formal treaty requiring the @entity141 to " advise and consent . " but the issue is not suited for a treaty . treaties impose equivalent obligations on all signatories . for example , the new start treaty limits @entity105 and the @entity0 to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads . but any agreement with @entity4 will not be so balanced . the restrictions and obligations in the final framework agreement will be imposed almost exclusively on @entity4 . the @entity107 are obligated only to ease and eventually remove most but not all economic sanctions , which were imposed as leverage to gain this final deal . finally some insist that any agreement must address @entity4 missile programs , human rights violations or support for @entity163 or @entity164 . as important as these issues are , and they must indeed be addressed , they are unrelated to the most important aim of a nuclear deal : preventing a nuclear @entity4 . to include them in the negotiations would be a poison pill . this agreement should be judged on its merits and on how it affects the security of our negotiating partners and allies , including @entity19 . those judgments should be fact - based , not based on questionable assertions or dubious assumptions .

( @entity2 ) the @entity0 and its negotiating partners reached a very strong framework agreement with @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , on thursday that limits @entity4 's nuclear program in such a way as to effectively block it from building a nuclear weapon*****1
expect pushback anyway , if the recent past is any harbinger*****0
just last month , in an attempt to head off such an agreement , house speaker @entity15 invited @entity19 prime minister @entity18 to preemptively blast it before @entity21 , and 47 senators sent a letter to the @entity4 leadership warning them away from a deal*****1
the debate that has already begun since the announcement of the new framework will likely result in more heat than light*****0
it will not be helped by the gathering swirl of dubious assumptions and doubtful assertions*****0
let us address some of these : the most misleading assertion , despite universal rejection by experts , is that the negotiations ' objective at the outset was the total elimination of any nuclear program in @entity4*****0
that is the position of @entity18 and his acolytes in the @entity21*****0
but that is not and never was the objective*****0
if it had been , there would have been no @entity4 team at the negotiating table*****0
rather , the objective has always been to structure an agreement or series of agreements so that @entity4 could not covertly develop a nuclear arsenal before the @entity0 and its allies could respond*****1
the new framework has exceeded expectations in achieving that goal*****0
it would reduce @entity4 's low - enriched uranium stockpile , cut by two - thirds its number of installed centrifuges and implement a rigorous inspection regime*****1
another dubious assumption of opponents is that the @entity4 nuclear program is a covert weapons program*****1
despite sharp accusations by some in the @entity0 and its allies , @entity4 denies having such a program , and @entity0 intelligence contends that @entity4 has not yet made the decision to build a nuclear weapon*****0
@entity4 's continued cooperation with @entity77 inspections is further evidence on this point , and we 'll know even more about @entity4 's program in the coming months and years because of the deal*****1
in fact , the inspections provisions that are part of this agreement are designed to protect against any covert action by the @entity4*****1
what 's more , the rhetoric of some members of @entity21 has implied that the negotiations have been between only the @entity0 and @entity4 ( i.e. , the 47 senators ' letter warning that a deal might be killed by @entity21 or a future president )*****1
this of course is not the case*****0
the talks were between @entity4 and the five permanent members of the @entity101 ( @entity0 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 ) plus @entity106 , dubbed the @entity107*****0
while the @entity0 has played a leading role in the effort , it negotiated the terms alongside its partners*****0
if the agreement reached by the @entity107 is rejected by @entity21 , it could result in an unraveling of the sanctions on @entity4 and threaten @entity116 cohesion in other areas*****1
another questionable assertion is that this agreement contains a sunset clause , after which @entity4 will be free to do as it pleases*****1
again , this is not the case*****0
some of the restrictions on @entity4 's nuclear activities , such as uranium enrichment , will be eased or eliminated over time , as long as 15 years*****1
but most importantly , the framework agreement includes @entity4 's ratification of the @entity127 , which allows @entity77 inspectors expanded access to nuclear sites both declared and nondeclared*****1
this provision will be permanent*****0
it does not sunset*****0
thus , going forward , if @entity4 decides to enrich uranium to weapons - grade levels , monitors will be able to detect such a move in a matter of days and alert the @entity101*****1
many in @entity21 have said that the agreement should be a formal treaty requiring the @entity141 to " advise and consent*****0
" but the issue is not suited for a treaty*****0
treaties impose equivalent obligations on all signatories*****0
for example , the new start treaty limits @entity105 and the @entity0 to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads*****0
but any agreement with @entity4 will not be so balanced*****1
the restrictions and obligations in the final framework agreement will be imposed almost exclusively on @entity4*****1
the @entity107 are obligated only to ease and eventually remove most but not all economic sanctions , which were imposed as leverage to gain this final deal*****0
finally some insist that any agreement must address @entity4 missile programs , human rights violations or support for @entity163 or @entity164*****1
as important as these issues are , and they must indeed be addressed , they are unrelated to the most important aim of a nuclear deal : preventing a nuclear @entity4*****1
to include them in the negotiations would be a poison pill*****0
this agreement should be judged on its merits and on how it affects the security of our negotiating partners and allies , including @entity19*****1
those judgments should be fact - based , not based on questionable assertions or dubious assumptions .*****0
