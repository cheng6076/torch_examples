( @entity2 ) recently , a @entity1 judge issued an opinion authorizing service of divorce papers on a husband completely via @entity7 . what exactly is " service of process " ? serving people with legal papers is an industry and its own body of law premised on one guiding principle : if you are going to sue someone , you should at least let them know about it . sounds simple , right ? in theory it is . in practice , it turns out people do n't like being sued . it also turns out that , to many defendants , procrastination of a lawsuit is a viable defense . just as you may avoid bad news in life , defendants tend to avoid process servers . once a defendant has been served , that means the judicial proceedings begin . unfortunately , that means defendants have an incentive to go " off the grid " . although every state is different , the law of service of process has evolved this way : the ideal and fairest way to notify a person of a lawsuit is to have another human hand the papers to the defendant in person , and have some proof that the person was the defendant . in - person service is not always possible , for obvious reasons . so , the law had to develop methods of alternate service , but carefully balance a defendant 's right to have notice of a lawsuit , against a diligent plaintiff 's access to court if a defendant is avoiding the inevitable . as reliable as the @entity69 mail is , regular mail is not a reliable form of serving papers . not because the postmen ca n't be trusted ; they can . neither snow , nor rain , nor heat , nor gloom of night , will keep them from delivering those papers . instead , it 's defendants -- no wait , all of humanity -- that ca n't be trusted . every one of us has ignored mail or even pretended we did n't get it . defendants are no different . one form of alternate service is " nail and mail " service . this means that you take a hammer and nail , and nail the papers to the defendant 's front door . the problem with that is that many defendants are nomadic by nature . just because you find a house that a defendant stayed at , does n't mean he 'll be back there anytime soon . another , even odder form of " service " is service by publication . this is an almost laughable legal fiction . if you ca n't find a defendant , a judge might let you serve by publication . that means that a plaintiff can take out an ad in five point font for a week in an obscure publication , on the off chance you are reading the classified ads of the @entity123 looking for lawsuits against you . as laughable as serving someone by tweeting it sounds , it 's at least more rational than this antiquated method . at first blush , the idea of service by @entity7 seems to offend traditional notions of ensuring notification of a defendant of a case against him . when it comes to serving papers , however , " traditional " does n't necessarily mean " good . " service by publication or nailing paper to the door of an empty apartment is hardly reliable ; it 's just service of last resort . for those people who are concerned that being served papers will become a @entity7 announcement in a news feed , along with the photos of dinner or kittens , to be " liked " by all your gawking " friends , " we 're not quite there ... yet . while the older forms of alternate service were public , most electronic service takes the form of email . where email is n't available , it is @entity7 private messaging , which should be as private as email . that 's the form of service authorized by the court here . so for now , we 're not quite putting lawsuits on @entity168 ... but i would n't rule it out in the future . online service may be a new frontier , but it 's not unheard of . most of us exist more online now than we " live " in a particular condo , or @entity177 's basement . virtually everyone has a phone or access to the @entity181 . not everyone has a lease or a mortgage . plus , online service has the added benefit of tracking . believe me , somewhere , some computer has already logged the fact that you read this article , how long you read it , and even how far down you scrolled before you got bored and bailed on the article ( thanks for still being here , by the way ) . in a way , maybe online service is long overdue . you can outrun a process server for a while , but sooner or later , all of us have to go back online -- and no human can outrun an email .

what exactly is " service of process " ? serving people with legal papers is an industry and its own body of law premised on one guiding principle : if you are going to sue someone , you should at least let them know about it*****1
sounds simple , right ? in theory it is*****0
in practice , it turns out people do n't like being sued*****0
it also turns out that , to many defendants , procrastination of a lawsuit is a viable defense*****0
just as you may avoid bad news in life , defendants tend to avoid process servers*****0
once a defendant has been served , that means the judicial proceedings begin*****0
unfortunately , that means defendants have an incentive to go " off the grid "*****0
although every state is different , the law of service of process has evolved this way : the ideal and fairest way to notify a person of a lawsuit is to have another human hand the papers to the defendant in person , and have some proof that the person was the defendant*****0
in - person service is not always possible , for obvious reasons*****0
so , the law had to develop methods of alternate service , but carefully balance a defendant 's right to have notice of a lawsuit , against a diligent plaintiff 's access to court if a defendant is avoiding the inevitable*****0
as reliable as the @entity69 mail is , regular mail is not a reliable form of serving papers*****0
not because the postmen ca n't be trusted ; they can*****0
neither snow , nor rain , nor heat , nor gloom of night , will keep them from delivering those papers*****0
instead , it 's defendants -- no wait , all of humanity -- that ca n't be trusted*****0
every one of us has ignored mail or even pretended we did n't get it*****0
defendants are no different*****0
one form of alternate service is " nail and mail " service*****0
this means that you take a hammer and nail , and nail the papers to the defendant 's front door*****0
the problem with that is that many defendants are nomadic by nature*****0
just because you find a house that a defendant stayed at , does n't mean he 'll be back there anytime soon*****0
another , even odder form of " service " is service by publication*****0
this is an almost laughable legal fiction*****0
if you ca n't find a defendant , a judge might let you serve by publication*****0
that means that a plaintiff can take out an ad in five point font for a week in an obscure publication , on the off chance you are reading the classified ads of the @entity123 looking for lawsuits against you*****0
as laughable as serving someone by tweeting it sounds , it 's at least more rational than this antiquated method*****0
at first blush , the idea of service by @entity7 seems to offend traditional notions of ensuring notification of a defendant of a case against him*****0
when it comes to serving papers , however , " traditional " does n't necessarily mean " good*****0
" service by publication or nailing paper to the door of an empty apartment is hardly reliable ; it 's just service of last resort*****0
for those people who are concerned that being served papers will become a @entity7 announcement in a news feed , along with the photos of dinner or kittens , to be " liked " by all your gawking " friends , " we 're not quite there ... yet*****1
while the older forms of alternate service were public , most electronic service takes the form of email*****0
where email is n't available , it is @entity7 private messaging , which should be as private as email*****0
that 's the form of service authorized by the court here*****0
so for now , we 're not quite putting lawsuits on @entity168 ... but i would n't rule it out in the future*****0
online service may be a new frontier , but it 's not unheard of*****0
most of us exist more online now than we " live " in a particular condo , or @entity177 's basement*****0
virtually everyone has a phone or access to the @entity181*****0
not everyone has a lease or a mortgage*****0
plus , online service has the added benefit of tracking*****0
believe me , somewhere , some computer has already logged the fact that you read this article , how long you read it , and even how far down you scrolled before you got bored and bailed on the article ( thanks for still being here , by the way )*****0
in a way , maybe online service is long overdue*****0
you can outrun a process server for a while , but sooner or later , all of us have to go back online -- and no human can outrun an email .*****0
