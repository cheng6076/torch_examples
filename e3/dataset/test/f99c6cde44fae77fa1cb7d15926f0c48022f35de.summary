" new day , new crisis , " @entity6 quips as she tells the story , as if it 's about her first day of college or a shopping trip gone wrong . it might as well be . when you 're allergic to life , a near - death experience is no big deal . less than a week after her trip to the hospital , @entity6 , 21 , is back at home in @entity0 , @entity1 . she lies on her back , her head near the foot of her bed , chattering away as her mom changes the access to her chest port . @entity56 , a paralegal by day , dons a mask and surgical gloves before disinfecting the area around the tube that 's connected to @entity6 's jugular vein . the disinfectant burns , and @entity6 's blood pressure hits 150/102 . her heart rate rockets to 128 .

@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) the cracker or the bite of ice cream -- @entity6 still is n't sure which one sent her into anaphylactic shock that day*****0
her food allergies change so frequently , keeping track is almost pointless*****0
it was just another day with another massive allergic reaction*****0

" new day , new crisis , " @entity6 quips as she tells the story , as if it 's about her first day of college or a shopping trip gone wrong*****0
it might as well be*****0
when you 're allergic to life , a near - death experience is no big deal*****0
less than a week after her trip to the hospital , @entity6 , 21 , is back at home in @entity0 , @entity1*****0
she lies on her back , her head near the foot of her bed , chattering away as her mom changes the access to her chest port*****0
@entity56 , a paralegal by day , dons a mask and surgical gloves before disinfecting the area around the tube that 's connected to @entity6 's jugular vein*****1
the disinfectant burns , and @entity6 's blood pressure hits 150/102*****0
her heart rate rockets to 128*****0
" the meds we have to give her to keep her alive , she reacts to , " @entity56 says , shaking her head*****0
" never in a million years did i think i would be doing this*****0

her father , @entity73 , jokingly rues the day she learned to talk*****0
she started taekwondo at the age of 9 and had her black belt by the time she was 11*****0

it was n't until shortly before her 16th birthday in 2010 that @entity6 had her first serious allergic reaction*****1
the next two years became a blur of sick days and doctors ' appointments*****0
@entity6 saw specialist after specialist*****0
the gastrointestinologist diagnosed her with gastroparesis , or partial paralysis of the stomach muscles*****0
a cardiologist said she had @entity97 , or @entity97 -- meaning that when she stood up for longer than a few minutes , her blood pressure dropped , leaving her light - headed and nauseated*****0
a @entity100 doctor diagnosed her with @entity101 , a connective tissue disorder that causes fragile skin and overly flexible joints*****0
after doing hours of research , @entity56 , @entity73 and @entity6 came up with their own diagnosis : mast cell disease*****1
they found a specialist online , dr. @entity110 , who at the time was working in @entity113*****0
they waited nearly nine months to see him , but hearing him confirm their suspicions was life - changing*****0
scientists do n't know yet what causes mast cell disease*****1
researchers have found mutations in mast cells that may cause the abnormal behavior , but the mutations vary from one patient to the next*****0
because of this , scientists suspect the mutations are acquired early in life*****0
but genetics may make some children more susceptible to developing the mutations*****0
mast cells are the regulators of your immune system*****0
they 're the ones that release histamine when a bug bites , or when you come into contact with an allergen*****0
they basically sound the alarm that lets the rest of your immune system know something is wrong*****0
until recently , the only mast cell disease doctors had identified was mastocytosis , which is characterized by " abnormal proliferation and activation " of the body 's mast cells -- meaning there are way too many and they act in strange ways*****1
but in the last few years doctors such as @entity110 have started to recognize that there are many different layers to mast cell disease*****1
for instance , @entity6 has mast cell activation syndrome , meaning her mast cells act strangely , but they 're not growing in number*****1
