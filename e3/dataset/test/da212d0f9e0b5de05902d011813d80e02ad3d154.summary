( @entity1 ) this is the time of the year when @entity3 the world over -- more than 2 billion of us -- reflect upon the crucifixion and resurrection of our lord . in light of the tragic massacre of christian college students in @entity12 on thursday , and the ongoing threat against @entity3 in other nations , this @entity8 we are calling upon @entity3 to also reflect upon the crucifixion , beheading , stoning , enforced slavery , sexual abuse , human trafficking , harassment , bombing and displacement of hundreds of thousands of @entity3 -- and others -- whose faith alone has made them a target of religious extremists . countless lives have been utterly destroyed in nations such as @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity12 and @entity35 . in june 2012 , bishop @entity36 of @entity29 told the @entity37 , " we beg you to help . we want only peace , security , and freedom . please no more death , no more explosions , no more injustice . " by then , nearly every remaining church in @entity29 had constructed a blast wall around its building to buffet the threat of the inevitable church bombing . this crisis escalated substantially last summer when @entity51 swept like lightning through @entity29 's @entity54 province , capturing the country 's second - largest city , @entity57 ; a city that was until 2014 a home of a thriving @entity61 community , there centuries before @entity62 . again and again the world did not respond as it might have , and now the inconceivable has happened : @entity29 's @entity64 has been emptied of its ancient @entity66 community , which existed there for more than 1,500 years . on march 27 , in a presentation to the @entity70 , @entity68 referred to the present reality of his fellow @entity29 @entity3 as a " catastrophic situation . " he 's right . rarely since the first century has the church in the @entity74 faced persecution on this scale . christian communities that took 2,000 years to build , and that were started by the apostles themselves , lie in ashes between the @entity81 and the @entity82 . survivors waste away as refugees , often in deplorable conditions , with no homes or churches to return to if the region eventually stabilizes . whether they be @entity90 , @entity91 or @entity92 , @entity61 communities are united in what @entity93 has called an " ecumenism of blood , " recognizing that @entity66 is experiencing more martyrdom today than in the first century . this is not an exaggerated or contrived crisis . as @entity101 , director of the @entity102 , has aptly put it , " piece by piece , @entity66 is being shattered .
