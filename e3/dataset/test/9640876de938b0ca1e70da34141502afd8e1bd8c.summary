( @entity1 ) pushed to his limits , a college professor took the extreme measure of threatening to fail his entire class . in an email to his students , @entity5 accused them of " backstabbing , game playing , cheating , lying , fighting . " the professor at the @entity13 expected his missive would create some conflict , but that it could then be resolved quickly -- and quietly . those hopes were dashed when one report by local media mushroomed into a tornado of nationwide coverage . the story went viral . suddenly , his name was spreading on @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , accompanied by the kind of strong , unvarnished opinions that you can make about people you 've never met . he was a hero who taught today 's entitled youth a much - needed lesson , or an egotistical nightmare of a teacher who threw a fit . one thing was certain : he , and his employer , were now thrust into a spotlight that neither had asked for . " i did what i did without any intention of seeing this in the news or seeing this on the @entity45 , " @entity5 said . " i will stand by what i did , but i 'm not career suicidal . " @entity13 says @entity5 remains an employee and that no one has asked him to stop teaching . but @entity5 , a nontenure - track professor in the maritime administration program , is afraid the notoriety will cost him this job and future jobs . @entity5 said his intent was not to be controversial , and the sharply worded email to students was not his first about the class . the day before writing to his students , @entity5 wrote a similar email to the ceo of the @entity63 and to the school 's chief academic officer . " i have never in my capacity as an academic ever encountered a class as completely disgraceful , dishonest and disrespectful " as his current strategic management class , he wrote to the administrators . he accused the students of shirking responsibility , making excuses and complaining their way to better grades . he would no longer teach the course and would fail the entire class , @entity5 wrote . " the class of graduating seniors is nothing more than a circus that is anything but academic , " he wrote . " but they are your problem now . " it was the next day that @entity5 wrote to the students , calling the class " an embarrassment in general , " and said that " i am frankly and completely disgusted . " once his words echoed in traditional and social media , the narrative -- angry prof flunks entire class -- might as well have been set in stone . the story was such a talker that even @entity97 offered a parody . " i 'm not looking to fail students , " @entity5 said . " i do n't get a bonus for failing students . " " the letter sounded a little bit more definite than i wanted it to , " he added . he never actually changed anyone 's grade . there were some students he was n't going to fail , he said , and some who were on the border who could have pulled themselves out . but @entity5 stands by his tough stance ; there was an issue of competency and of professionalism that had to be addressed , he said . the course in question is a capstone course for a maritime administration degree and is supposed to merge what the students learned in their other business courses . " i had a large majority of people taking the capstone course who could not do a break - even analysis , " the professor said . " if you can not do a break - even analysis , then you do n't deserve a bachelor 's degree in business . " his other complaint was about professionalism . @entity5 said students would swear at him , cheat and spread rumors about him online . this is related to their grades , he said , because dealing with people you do n't like is a business skill . on online message boards , users claiming to be students in the class accused the professor of exaggerating the situation or fabricating parts of his story . one purported student called @entity5 " a little obnoxious , " but said he is a good teacher and fair if you follow his rules . should the professor have been surprised that his email went viral ? the fiery language and strong allegations were likely to be news if the email went public , but maybe there is more to it . the situation hits on a popular argument on the media and @entity45 : what do we think of millennials ? reflecting on his most recent class , @entity5 said there is some truth to stereotypes of millennials as entitled and pampered . he mentioned the overdependence of students on cell phones and other electronics , and the power those devices have to interrupt concentration . the other factor is a failure of k - 12 education , said @entity5 , who has met college students who do n't know how to convert fractions to decimals . " what i 'm trying to do is to give an honest assessment of their performance , " he said . in a statement , @entity190 , the vice president for academic affairs and chief academic officer at @entity63 , said the entire class will not be failed . " each student will receive an individual grade based upon work completed during the semester , " @entity190 said . " the university is listening to concerns about this issue from students and faculty and will address them according to our policies . " the flurry of attention is unwelcome and @entity5 fears it will affect his career in academia . but it 's likely his story will have a short shelf life . people probably will forget about it and turn their attention to the next grabby headline . but he said he thinks this episode will follow him everywhere . he said he feels a public shaming of sorts . online public shaming has become a research topic of its own . people who have been pilloried online for comments they made wonder if they will get a second chance .
