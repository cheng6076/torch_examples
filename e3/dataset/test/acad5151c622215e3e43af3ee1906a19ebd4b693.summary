tuesday , after being picked up by the tugboat off the coast of @entity17*****0
the two boats they had been in were barely seaworthy , the tug 's @entity19 captain told me*****1
the discarded coats , he said , would be thrown away*****0
we had flown to @entity14 from @entity26 following news that as many as 400 migrants had been lost at sea*****0

this small group in @entity13 were among nearly 10,000 migrants who have arrived on @entity47 shores since the weekend , according to the @entity47 @entity48*****1
with the onset of spring and calmer seas , it appears that the flow of migrants is not relenting*****0
the group , which included 31 women , was composed mostly of @entity56 and @entity57*****0

it seems that all the victims of the multiple tragedies and woes of @entity11 and the @entity35 -- grinding poverty , war and the rise of @entity99 -- are washing up on the shores of @entity47*****0
the wars , unrest , upheaval , misery and injustice i 've covered over the last 20 years , in @entity107 , in @entity17 , in @entity123 and elsewhere , seem to be coming together to remind those who have enjoyed @entity80 's relative peace and prosperity that no man is an island*****0
the small group of migrants in @entity13 has been taken in by the @entity47 authorities*****1
they 've been fed , clothed , received medical treatment , and will be taken to migrant camp in northern @entity47*****0
