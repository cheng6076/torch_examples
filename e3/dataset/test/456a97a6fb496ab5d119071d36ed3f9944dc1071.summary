( @entity1 ) the terrorist group @entity0 has claimed an attack on @entity3 in eastern @entity4 , in which many people have been killed and still more taken hostage . the attack is another step in the ongoing escalation of the terrorist group 's activities , and a clear indicator that the security situation in @entity14 is deteriorating fast . @entity15 - based @entity0 has been behind a string of recent attacks in @entity4 , the most well - known of them being the massacre at the @entity20 in @entity21 in 2013 . cross-border raids into @entity4 by the group , however , date back to 2011 . @entity0 incursions triggered a military response by the government in @entity21 , which sent troops to @entity15 as part of an @entity30 mission in support of @entity15 's internationally recognized government that had been under pressure from @entity0 and other militants for several years . @entity0 is predominantly driven by the same radical interpretation of the @entity36 as @entity37 and @entity38 ( also known as @entity39 ) , but also employs more opportunistic approaches to shoring up local support . its origins lie in @entity43 ( @entity43 ) , one of several militant factions that emerged in the wake of the fall of @entity48 in 1991 . these disparate groups fought each other and a @entity52 peacekeeping mission in the @entity15 civil war that led to the complete collapse of the country , from which it has yet to recover almost quarter of a century later . @entity0 ( literally " the youth " ) split from @entity43 in 2003 and merged with another radical @entity60 group , the so - called @entity59 . as their alliance obtained control of @entity15 's capital @entity69 in 2006 , @entity61 , the only majority @entity62 country in the region , took military action against the group . the offensive weakened @entity0 and pushed it back into the rural areas of central and southern @entity15 , but it failed to defeat it . to the contrary , @entity61 's invasion and occupation of parts of @entity15 -- although invited by the @entity15 government and backed by the @entity30 -- enabled @entity0 to partially re-invent itself as both an @entity60 and nationalist force opposing a foreign " @entity62 " invasion . initially , the group primarily attacked @entity61 forces , but soon began to " expand " its activities against the @entity15 government as well . the first attack outside @entity15 was an attack in the @entity87 capital of @entity88 in 2010 . soon after this , cross-border raids in @entity4 began , predominantly targeting @entity62 there . increasing its links with @entity37 , @entity0 declared its full allegiance in 2012 -- and it is not clear whether it will switch allegiances to @entity38 . much will depend on how the relationships between @entity95 ( @entity95 ) , a long - time ally of @entity0 based in @entity97 , and @entity38 develop . the key point is that @entity0 's attack in @entity100 is part of a broader regional context of instability fueled by a huge number of factors . it must not be interpreted simply as another act of garden - variety fundamentalist terrorism . clearly , the presence and activities of terrorist groups in the region is a major concern , and it is undoubtedly driven by radical and exclusivist interpretations of @entity114 . but the entire region also suffers from a range of other problems : from economic development challenges to environmental degradation ; from organized crime to inter-tribal and inter-communal violence ; from corruption to serious deficits in human rights and good governance . these entrenched inequalities help @entity0 appeal to a wide variety of potential recruits , who may sympathize with and actively support the group for any number of reasons . attacking a university in northern @entity4 and separating @entity62 from @entity136 students epitomizes the way @entity0 advances itself by exploiting religious , tribal and nationalist identities . ultimately , though , this all comes down to a struggle for control -- over people , over territory , and over resources . as long as the majority of people in the region remain excluded from any meaningful political , economic , and social participation in their societies -- which are dominated by primarily self - interested elites that put their own advance before that of their communities -- human lives matter little in the pursuit of selfish interests . it is important to counter @entity0 directly , including by military means . but there wo n't be any lasting solution to the wider region 's security problems without a more comprehensive and concerted effort to address the deeper problems of exclusion suffered by the citizens of the countries challenged by @entity0 . as @entity100 shows , these problems are still providing oxygen for nihilistic ideologies and their deadly fruit . copyright 2015 @entity173 . some rights reserved .

( @entity1 ) the terrorist group @entity0 has claimed an attack on @entity3 in eastern @entity4 , in which many people have been killed and still more taken hostage*****1
the attack is another step in the ongoing escalation of the terrorist group 's activities , and a clear indicator that the security situation in @entity14 is deteriorating fast*****1
@entity15 - based @entity0 has been behind a string of recent attacks in @entity4 , the most well - known of them being the massacre at the @entity20 in @entity21 in 2013*****1
cross-border raids into @entity4 by the group , however , date back to 2011*****1
@entity0 incursions triggered a military response by the government in @entity21 , which sent troops to @entity15 as part of an @entity30 mission in support of @entity15 's internationally recognized government that had been under pressure from @entity0 and other militants for several years*****1
@entity0 is predominantly driven by the same radical interpretation of the @entity36 as @entity37 and @entity38 ( also known as @entity39 ) , but also employs more opportunistic approaches to shoring up local support*****0
its origins lie in @entity43 ( @entity43 ) , one of several militant factions that emerged in the wake of the fall of @entity48 in 1991*****0
these disparate groups fought each other and a @entity52 peacekeeping mission in the @entity15 civil war that led to the complete collapse of the country , from which it has yet to recover almost quarter of a century later*****0
@entity0 ( literally " the youth " ) split from @entity43 in 2003 and merged with another radical @entity60 group , the so - called @entity59*****1
as their alliance obtained control of @entity15 's capital @entity69 in 2006 , @entity61 , the only majority @entity62 country in the region , took military action against the group*****1
the offensive weakened @entity0 and pushed it back into the rural areas of central and southern @entity15 , but it failed to defeat it*****0
to the contrary , @entity61 's invasion and occupation of parts of @entity15 -- although invited by the @entity15 government and backed by the @entity30 -- enabled @entity0 to partially re-invent itself as both an @entity60 and nationalist force opposing a foreign " @entity62 " invasion*****0
initially , the group primarily attacked @entity61 forces , but soon began to " expand " its activities against the @entity15 government as well*****1
the first attack outside @entity15 was an attack in the @entity87 capital of @entity88 in 2010*****0
soon after this , cross-border raids in @entity4 began , predominantly targeting @entity62 there*****0
increasing its links with @entity37 , @entity0 declared its full allegiance in 2012 -- and it is not clear whether it will switch allegiances to @entity38*****1
much will depend on how the relationships between @entity95 ( @entity95 ) , a long - time ally of @entity0 based in @entity97 , and @entity38 develop*****0
the key point is that @entity0 's attack in @entity100 is part of a broader regional context of instability fueled by a huge number of factors*****0
it must not be interpreted simply as another act of garden - variety fundamentalist terrorism*****0
clearly , the presence and activities of terrorist groups in the region is a major concern , and it is undoubtedly driven by radical and exclusivist interpretations of @entity114*****0
but the entire region also suffers from a range of other problems : from economic development challenges to environmental degradation ; from organized crime to inter-tribal and inter-communal violence ; from corruption to serious deficits in human rights and good governance*****0
these entrenched inequalities help @entity0 appeal to a wide variety of potential recruits , who may sympathize with and actively support the group for any number of reasons*****1
attacking a university in northern @entity4 and separating @entity62 from @entity136 students epitomizes the way @entity0 advances itself by exploiting religious , tribal and nationalist identities*****1
ultimately , though , this all comes down to a struggle for control -- over people , over territory , and over resources*****0
as long as the majority of people in the region remain excluded from any meaningful political , economic , and social participation in their societies -- which are dominated by primarily self - interested elites that put their own advance before that of their communities -- human lives matter little in the pursuit of selfish interests*****0
it is important to counter @entity0 directly , including by military means*****1
but there wo n't be any lasting solution to the wider region 's security problems without a more comprehensive and concerted effort to address the deeper problems of exclusion suffered by the citizens of the countries challenged by @entity0*****1
as @entity100 shows , these problems are still providing oxygen for nihilistic ideologies and their deadly fruit*****0
