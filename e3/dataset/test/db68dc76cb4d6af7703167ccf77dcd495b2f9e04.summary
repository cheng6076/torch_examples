( @entity2 ) the idea of sustainable development is that raw capitalism is far too powerful for its own good*****0
global capitalism is a juggernaut , with the world economy now doubling in size every generation*****0
yet on a finite @entity12 , with a billion new people being added every 15 years , that juggernaut is now laying siege to the physical bases of life and the social support systems that make life pleasant and decent*****0
sustainable development offers a path out of this growing crisis*****0
the reality is that raw capitalism is the economics of greed*****1
unleash greed , the theory goes , and type - a personalities around the world will spend inordinate energy to organize businesses , invent new products , and thereby raise well - being*****0
and in some sense , there 's a lot to say for this theory*****0
after all , the world economy has expanded at least 100-fold since modern industrial capitalism first found its footing in @entity38 around 1800 , and for most of the world , living standards have risen markedly along the way*****0
yet history has also taught us that the " @entity45 " of the free market is a little less miraculous than it looks*****0
instead , untrammeled greed also leads to massive fraud , mega-tax evasion , pervasive bribery , modern slavery , rising inequalities , and environmental destruction*****0
perhaps most important , it feeds moral blindness*****0
too many of the super-rich , whether they are calling for drilling in the @entity58 for oil or encouraging the cutting down of the rainforests for tropical hardwoods , simply deny the irreparable damage they are causing to the planet*****0
it¹s no surprise that the @entity65 runs anti-environmental editorials on what feels like a daily basis*****0
the environment is a nuisance and a hindrance to greed*****0
and greed rules the moral order at the top of raw capitalism*****1
novelists , ethicists , activists , unionists , preachers , teachers , and others have long known these facts , but the juggernaut has proved hard to tame*****0
unleash greed as the supreme economic good , and it is greed that we get as the ultimate moral arbiter*****0
sustainable development is a doctrine that says : let us once again place the economy on a true moral foundation and we 'll keep greed within bounds , ensuring the economic growth is combined with social fairness and environmental sustainability*****0
the idea of sustainable development is that an economy must satisfy all three principles : economic growth , social fairness and environmental sustainability*****0
yes , there can and should be economic growth , especially for today 's developing countries*****0
human ingenuity and markets can indeed lead us to higher living standards and longer lives for all parts of the world , rich and poor alike*****0
but these gains should be widely shared and should never be based on the exploitation of those at the bottom of society*****0
social inclusion has been widely shown to improve societal progress broadly for all*****0
and equally important , those gains should be based on true value added , not on the destruction of natural capital , whether through deforestation , climate change , or pollution of air , land , and water*****0
thus , sustainable development calls for a holistic approach that combines economic , social , and environmental objectives*****0
this balanced approach is much harder to achieve than the raw capitalism that places the economy above society and the physical @entity12*****1
yet it recognizes that we are doomed to conflict and even collapse if we fail to promote social equality and environmental sustainability*****0
just look at the recent news*****0
last year was the @entity12 's hottest year on record , and another year of mega-storms , droughts , floods , and heat waves*****1
major parts of the world , from @entity149 and @entity150 to @entity151 and @entity152 , are experiencing mega-droughts , and the prospect of catastrophic water scarcity in the future unless something changes*****0
and even as the world economy grows and millions escape extreme poverty , our societies become more unequal , less trusting , and corrupt*****0
all over the world , there is unrest on the streets even as our generation is the beneficiary of unprecedented technological knowhow and material progress*****0
in my new book , @entity173 , i¹ve not only analyzed the trends of growing inequality and rising environmental destruction , but have also shown how the concepts of sustainable development can be used to chart a way out of our growing crisis*****0
it turns out that with goodwill , cooperation , greed kept in check , and technological savvy , we can build a modern global economy that is productive , inclusive , and environmentally sustainable all at the same time*****0
the ongoing revolution of information and communications technology ( @entity194 ) is an incredibly powerful enabler of new sustainable technologies*****0
and doubters about the feasibility of sustainable development should have a look at @entity201 , @entity202 , and @entity203 , as they are the closest on the planet to achieving this @entity205 of prosperity , fairness , and sustainability*****0
consider the challenge of climate change , for example*****0
@entity213 and @entity214 executives too often simply deny the science*****0
yet a science - based sustainable development perspective shows that not only is human - induced climate change very real and very dangerous , but that it is also solvable at very low cost by switching over the next 30 years to electric vehicles , heat pumps , well - insulated buildings , smart @entity194 - enabled grid , wind and solar energy , and other low - carbon and energy efficient technologies*****0
if the world takes the time to do its homework and plan for the future , the world can bring the climate crisis under control and still enjoy a growing supply of quality energy services*****0
and , more generally , although the @entity239 political system still feeds untrammeled greed by enabling super-rich campaign donors and lobbyists to buy the political class , the @entity239 people and much of the rest of the world are coming to recognize the urgency of sustainable development*****0
that is why governments around the world will adopt @entity252 ( @entity253 ) this year , on the 70th anniversary of the @entity255*****0
these new @entity253 will become markers and guideposts for building a world that combines prosperity , fairness , and environmental sanity -- a world we truly want and need for ourselves and our children .*****0
