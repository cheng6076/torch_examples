@entity0 ( @entity1 ) a @entity3 prince has challenged populist @entity5 politician @entity4 to a duel in @entity0 's @entity7 over his immigration policy . @entity4 , the leader of the @entity5 @entity9 ( @entity9 ) , complains that @entity5 's membership of the @entity11 means it is powerless to stop a flow of foreign immigrants , many from impoverished @entity15 , into his " small island " nation . in a video posted on @entity20 , prince @entity18 said he was fed up with discrimination against @entity3 living in @entity5 . " the most idiotic example i 've heard of has been mr. @entity4 blaming migrants for traffic jams on the @entity26 , " @entity22 said . holding a sword that had belonged to his father -- a @entity30 war hero -- the prince laid down a verbal gauntlet . " enough is enough , mr. @entity4 . so what i 'd like to do , mr. @entity4 , is to challenge you to a duel , " he said . " i would like us to meet in @entity7 one morning with our swords and resolve this matter in the way that an 18th century @entity3 aristocrat and an @entity42 gentleman would traditionally do . " are you up for it mr. @entity4 ? " @entity4 -- who is on the campaign trail ahead of @entity5 's general elections on may 7 -- said he did not intend to cross swords with the prince . " it is an impressive sword . i do n't have one but i 'm sure we could find one if we had to . but i 'm not intending to accept the offer , " a spokesman quoted him as saying . " i would have thought that a @entity3 prince with a long @entity3 lineage would rather agree with me that it 's a complete tragedy for @entity3 that it 's lost so many of its brightest and best young people . " @entity9 wants @entity5 to leave the @entity11 . it says it would not seek to remain a party to the region 's free trade or economic treaties " while those treaties maintain a principle of free movement of labor , which prevents the @entity5 managing its own borders . " it has also pledged to cut the country 's £ 9 billion ( $ 12.4b ) annual foreign aid budget . another @entity9 politician appeared to back his party leader 's chances in a duel , tweeting an image of a medieval knight sliced in two , with the comment : " this is what @entity4 would do to him . " but there was no word on whether @entity4 would even accept the prince 's less life - threatening back - up challenge . " alternatively , if you do n't agree or if your sword is a little bit rusty , mr. @entity4 , we can meet for a different kind of duel -- a duel with words in a tv studio in the run - up to the elections , " @entity18 suggested . " i 'm up for it , it would be really nice , hopefully you will agree . " @entity18 posted a separate video on @entity20 entitled " 7 reasons why the @entity5 should love the @entity3 , " in which he pointed to a @entity101 newspaper headline from march reading : " we need more migrants ... they are the best workers in @entity5 . " the headline , he said , applied " principally " to the @entity3 . " what i can not accept is the amount of hostility and in some cases hatred towards the @entity3 . enough is enough , i say , this has got to stop . " @entity18 pointed to @entity3 contributions to @entity5 including those made by @entity3 @entity114 pilots during the @entity115 , what he said was a " wonderful work ethic " and easy integration into the community . " we are often more loyal to @entity5 than many @entity5 people i know , " he said . " we are very grateful to be here . we would like you to be grateful too . please stop knocking the @entity3 . we love this country we would like @entity5 to love us too . "
