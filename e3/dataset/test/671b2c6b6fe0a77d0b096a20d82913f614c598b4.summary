" an internet search for " @entity5 " and " jovial " yields thousands of results . he certainly has gone a long way to bring @entity8 in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community . but there are some facts about @entity5 that are less well - known . here are six : in september 2013 , @entity5 tweeted " happy @entity33 , " referring to the @entity33 . that prompted @entity35 , the daughter of @entity37 minority leader @entity36 , to respond with a tweet of her own : " thanks . @entity40 would be even sweeter if you would end @entity8 's @entity42 , sir . " and , perhaps to her surprise , @entity36 got a response . " @entity8 never denied it , " @entity5 tweeted back . " the man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone . @entity48 . " the reference was likely to former @entity8 president @entity50 , who had left office the previous month . @entity5 was nominated to be foreign minister by @entity50 's successor , @entity53 . his foreign ministry notes , perhaps defensively , that " due to the political and security conditions of the time , he decided to continue his education in the @entity11 .

" later on the same page , however , his date of birth is listed as january 8 , 1960 . and the @entity90 website says he was born in in 1961 so he is 54 , 55 or maybe even 56 . whichever , he is still considerably younger than his opposite number , @entity10 , who is 71 . the feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the @entity95 , a charitable organization . the @entity96 said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the @entity8 government to launder money and get around @entity11 sanctions . but last year , a settlement in the case , under which the foundation agreed to give a 36 - story building in @entity106 along with other properties to the @entity11 government , did not mention @entity5 's name . early in the @entity66 , @entity5 was among the students who took over the @entity111 in @entity112 . the aim , says the website @entity115 -- which cites @entity5 's memoirs , titled " mr. ambassador " -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently @entity119 . later , the website says , @entity5 went to make a similar protest at the @entity8 mission to the @entity123 . in response , the @entity8 ambassador to the @entity123 offered him a job . in fact , he has now spent more time with @entity10 than any other foreign minister in the world . and that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men , with help from other foreign ministers as well , try to meet a june 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in @entity140 .
