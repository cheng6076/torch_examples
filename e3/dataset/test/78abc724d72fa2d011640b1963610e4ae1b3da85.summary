( @entity1 ) on may 28 , 2014 , some 7,000 people gathered in a stadium in @entity4 's northwestern @entity3*****0
but they had not come to watch the local football team or any other grand sporting event*****0
instead , the authorities paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits*****0
armed soldiers guarded the exits*****0
in the patently unfair , open air trial that followed , 55 people were found guilty of a range of offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and jailed*****0
three were sentenced to death*****0
the public mass sentencing was part a @entity4 's " @entity28 " campaign against unrest in @entity3 , a campaign the government claims was launched to combat " terrorism " and " separatism*****0
" but it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided , and often cynical , attempt to tackle crime and terrorism*****1
today , @entity37 releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide*****1
much of it makes for grim reading*****1
in @entity42 , the government lifted a six - year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific @entity48 attack on a school in @entity50 in december*****0
more than 60 people have been put to death since , and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows*****0
@entity57 and @entity58 executed people for " terrorism , " and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes*****0
in a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before , governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee - jerk reaction to terrorism*****0
other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates*****0
@entity77 ended an eight - year moratorium in december , putting 11 murder convicts to death , with the government saying it was a move to end a surge in violent crime*****0
in @entity86 , authorities announced plans to execute mainly drug traffickers to tackle a public safety " national emergency*****0
" six people have already been executed this year*****0
a sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool*****1
the rise was largely because of developments in @entity99 and @entity100 , where courts imposed hundreds of death sentences in the context of internal political instability or crime and armed conflict*****0
the simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both*****1
there is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence , as @entity119 and other studies have repeatedly confirmed*****0
it is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough*****1
at @entity37 , we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades*****1
thankfully , most of the world now appears to agree with us*****0
the numbers speak for themselves*****0
in 1945 when the @entity119 was founded , only eight countries had abolished the death penalty*****1
today , 140 states are abolitionist in law or practice*****0
last year , we recorded executions in 22 countries , down by almost a half from 20 years ago*****0
despite the troubling developments we recorded last year , there was still much good news to be found*****0
the number of executions recorded around the world dropped significantly in 2014 compared with the previous year , from 778 to 607*****0
this number does not include @entity4 , where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together , but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret , the true figure is impossible to determine*****1
executions were recorded in only three countries in @entity157 -- @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 -- and the number of people put to death went down by more than a quarter*****1
the @entity164 continued to be execution - free , apart from the @entity165*****0
those governments that still execute need to realize that they are on the wrong side of history*****1
they must join the vast majority of countries which have dropped the ultimate cruel punishment*****0
fighting for an end to the death penalty remains an uphill task , but all of us must try to make the world free of this punishment*****1
with determination , i know that we can achieve this goal .*****0
