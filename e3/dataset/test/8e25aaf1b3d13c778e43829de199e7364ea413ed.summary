( @entity0 ) this is week three of an ongoing series : a @entity2 . read week one and week two . when i started this project , my brother texted me , " wait until you get to @entity7 . " by sunday afternoon , i understood what he meant . i am horrified by the story of @entity7 in @entity10 . lot and the destruction of @entity13 was new to me . i actually had n't put two and two together that @entity13 is the origin of the word sodomy . ( feel free to call me dense as you read this ) . @entity7 is the central character in the grim story of @entity13 's demise in @entity22 . you are introduced to the city by @entity24 who tries to save the town . in the preceding chapter , @entity24 asks @entity28 to agree that if he can find 10 good people in the town , @entity28 wo n't smite it . @entity28 agrees . @entity7 is visited by divine emissaries to investigate if there are indeed enough good people to save the town . the men of the town come to seek out the new visitors for " intimacies . " ahem . yeah . hospitable bunch , huh ? those " intimacies , " we are meant to understand , account for @entity13 's wickedness . and i guess meant that the town was doomed . ( " intimacies " is the term used in my 1991 edition of the @entity45 . the revised edition refers to " sexual relations . " ) to protect the emissaries from the mob , @entity7 offers up his virginal daughters . which . ugh . anyway , it does n't work . there apparently are n't enough good men to save @entity13 , which leads to @entity28 destroying yet another population in @entity10 . oh , and while @entity7 's chosen family members flee the destruction , @entity56 turns around and is turned to salt . she had been warned not to look back . after @entity28 destroys @entity13 , @entity7 's daughters worry that there are n't any men left , so they get their father good and drunk and have sex with him . they need to have children to keep the human race going , the logic goes , i guess . after reading that section , i put my @entity45 down . i could n't read anymore . then i read it again . what was i reading ? what are the morals , the meaning , i 'm supposed to get from these ghastly stories ? this is not the @entity28 that i have known for nearly 42 years . it 's not the version of the @entity28 i pray to daily . i truly do n't believe in a @entity28 that wipes out a town in general because of sexuality . why are they wicked ? i do n't believe that my @entity28 that would go after one group -- any group . the @entity28 that i pray to does n't punish the " wicked " like this . i ca n't comprehend this version of @entity28 . i ca n't believe in that kind of @entity28 . there were much easier things to write about this week in the pages that i read . but , i want to be truthful with you , my readers . the @entity7 story struck me -- hard . i wish that i had answers for you as to why this happened or how it was written many years ago . but i do n't . it could be that it was a tale told to make sure that people only had sex to have children . or it could be a morality tale for the times . the truth is : i do n't really know . i just know that my faith does n't include the idea of such a punitive @entity28 . i now fully understand how you could devote your life to reading and analyzing the @entity45 . and when i read this rough draft to my brother , he said to me , " you have just hit the tip of the iceberg .

( @entity0 ) this is week three of an ongoing series : a @entity2*****1
read week one and week two*****0
when i started this project , my brother texted me , " wait until you get to @entity7*****0
" by sunday afternoon , i understood what he meant*****0
i am horrified by the story of @entity7 in @entity10*****0
lot and the destruction of @entity13 was new to me*****0
i actually had n't put two and two together that @entity13 is the origin of the word sodomy*****0
( feel free to call me dense as you read this )*****0
@entity7 is the central character in the grim story of @entity13 's demise in @entity22*****1
you are introduced to the city by @entity24 who tries to save the town*****0
in the preceding chapter , @entity24 asks @entity28 to agree that if he can find 10 good people in the town , @entity28 wo n't smite it*****0
@entity28 agrees*****0
@entity7 is visited by divine emissaries to investigate if there are indeed enough good people to save the town*****0
the men of the town come to seek out the new visitors for " intimacies*****0
" ahem*****0
yeah*****0
hospitable bunch , huh ? those " intimacies , " we are meant to understand , account for @entity13 's wickedness*****0
and i guess meant that the town was doomed*****0
( " intimacies " is the term used in my 1991 edition of the @entity45*****0
the revised edition refers to " sexual relations*****0
" ) to protect the emissaries from the mob , @entity7 offers up his virginal daughters*****0
which*****0
ugh*****0
anyway , it does n't work*****0
there apparently are n't enough good men to save @entity13 , which leads to @entity28 destroying yet another population in @entity10*****0
oh , and while @entity7 's chosen family members flee the destruction , @entity56 turns around and is turned to salt*****1
she had been warned not to look back*****0
after @entity28 destroys @entity13 , @entity7 's daughters worry that there are n't any men left , so they get their father good and drunk and have sex with him*****1
they need to have children to keep the human race going , the logic goes , i guess*****0
after reading that section , i put my @entity45 down*****0
i could n't read anymore*****0
then i read it again*****0
what was i reading ? what are the morals , the meaning , i 'm supposed to get from these ghastly stories ? this is not the @entity28 that i have known for nearly 42 years*****0
it 's not the version of the @entity28 i pray to daily*****0
i truly do n't believe in a @entity28 that wipes out a town in general because of sexuality*****0
why are they wicked ? i do n't believe that my @entity28 that would go after one group -- any group*****0
the @entity28 that i pray to does n't punish the " wicked " like this*****0
i ca n't comprehend this version of @entity28*****0
i ca n't believe in that kind of @entity28*****0
there were much easier things to write about this week in the pages that i read*****0
but , i want to be truthful with you , my readers*****0
the @entity7 story struck me -- hard*****0
i wish that i had answers for you as to why this happened or how it was written many years ago*****0
but i do n't*****0
it could be that it was a tale told to make sure that people only had sex to have children*****0
or it could be a morality tale for the times*****0
the truth is : i do n't really know*****0
i just know that my faith does n't include the idea of such a punitive @entity28*****0
i now fully understand how you could devote your life to reading and analyzing the @entity45*****0
and when i read this rough draft to my brother , he said to me , " you have just hit the tip of the iceberg*****0
" so , i will continue reading .*****0
