( @entity2 ) after two days of deliberation , jurors found @entity3 guilty on all counts in the @entity5*****1
the verdict is n't surprising*****0
what might be , however , is the answer to how we prevent this kind of violence from happening again*****1
because there could be other more young men just like him , which means the lessons we take from @entity17 will affect whether we can keep @entity18 and @entity18 safer*****0
today , nearly 1 out of 4 people in the world are @entity21*****1
by 2050 , @entity23 reports , that will be some 1 out of 3*****1
by 2070 ? well , i 'll quote the all - caps headline reprinted by the drudge report : " @entity21 to outnumber @entity27 ! " many @entity18 read such numbers and worry : will this mean more @entity29 ? but that 's only if you believe @entity32 causes extremism , which many have argued*****1
and that 's wrong , of course*****0
on the other hand , there are people who claim @entity32 has nothing to do with terrorism*****0
which is true — and false*****0
sure , the @entity43 faith forbids murder , but there 's a small but significant minority of @entity21 murdering people in terrible ways , and in @entity32 's name*****1
understanding what leads young @entity21 like @entity3 down a dangerous path requires we understand radicalization*****1
at any given moment in the @entity55 , we have little idea who 's going to attack whom next , who 's on whom 's side , how this is going to end , or what anyone 's even fighting over anymore*****0
this bad news is going to turn worse before it gets better*****0
but it will get better*****0
to understand why , we have to take a stab at understanding what radicalizes @entity21 contrary to common belief , @entity21 are n't unusually predisposed to violence*****1
@entity32 , which has taken on an ugly life of its own , began at the intersection of politics , religion and religious identity*****0
@entity32 is about what you believe , but it 's also about being part of a community*****1
and what happens when you are a member of a community and you see it under attack ? some @entity21 who have turned to violence have done so with good intentions ( the road to hell , after all )*****1
consider : the tragedy of modern @entity32 is in its endless sequence of tragedies*****0
before my time , the brutal @entity92 invasion of @entity93 horrified many @entity21*****0
when i was in high school , @entity95 occupied all our attention*****0
there was of course @entity102 's brutal war on the @entity104 people — @entity3 shares his name with a recent @entity104 patriot -- and @entity108 's ongoing occupation of the @entity110 territories*****0
and the blows against @entity21 do n't end there*****0
there was @entity115 's war on @entity116 , another war in @entity118 , the invasion of @entity120 , oppression in @entity122 , civil strife in @entity124 , the colonization of @entity126 , massacres of @entity21 in the @entity128 , wars on a besieged @entity130 and @entity131 still under @entity108 rule*****1
imagine how this looks to a restless young muslim*****0
countless places where co-religionists have been killed , and nobody seems to do anything about it*****0
nobody even wants to*****0
extremists have long offered crude reasons for why the violence was happening , and then moved quickly to a single , tempting , terrible response : take up arms — and kill*****0
in her new book , " heretic : why @entity32 needs a @entity154 " , @entity150 argues that extremism is n't caused by political circumstances , but by @entity32 itself*****0
her conclusion is wrong*****0
to fight extremism , we do n't need to reform @entity32*****0
we need to show young @entity21 that extremism is doing the opposite of what it claimed to*****1
rather than help @entity21 , it 's harming them*****0
when i was a teenager , our @entity164 mosque hosted a delegation from @entity95 that shared graphic , heartbreaking stories of rape , exile , and massacre inflicted on @entity21 , all because of their faith*****0
the mosque raised money , collected food , blankets , medicine*****0
promises were made to provide more , and regularly*****0
but we all knew that was n't enough*****0
as we left the mosque , my peers and i were disgruntled and confused*****0
shocked*****0
angry*****0
our teachers could 've told us : go and fight*****0
defend your @entity21 brothers and sisters who are under siege*****0
or they could 've told us to keep our heads down and make money and live comfortably*****0
neither answer would have satisfied*****0
fortunately for us , they offered us a third way*****0
they showed us , patiently , how to work with others , how to compromise , how to get things done*****0
a more engaged @entity18 @entity21 community , they explained , could use its resources to help people suffering all around the world*****1
they were right*****0
we saw the dead - end road of radicalism from afar , but we also saw , up close , how communities that isolated themselves and turned inward found themselves powerless , ineffectual and ignored*****0
thanks to social media , a medium that the world 's burgeoning young @entity21 population is increasingly comfortable with , more muslims can and will see this , too*****1
radicalism will be done in by fellow @entity21 who want to save their religion from this monster within it*****0
it 's happening already*****0
our national conversation about @entity32 is focused on the wrong issues*****0
does @entity32 need a reformation ? what in @entity32 causes violence ? we would do a lot better if we accepted that @entity21 the world over have real grievances — dictatorships , corruption , foreign intervention , religious illiteracy , lack of economic opportunity -- and radicals exploit these*****1
we need to show the young @entity233 that , if they want to help , then violence is n't going to help*****1
to fight extremism , we need to pose this question to young @entity21 : " do you want to help your brothers and sisters in faith ? " because those who claim to be defending us are making things so much worse*****1
their narrative has failed*****0
their solution is bankrupt*****0
the @entity244 wears no clothes*****0
it 's the reason why increasing numbers of @entity21 reject extremism -- and not just because our numbers are increasing .*****0
