( @entity2 ) an @entity1 report is calling for authorities to address the number of attacks on women 's rights activists in @entity7 . the report , entitled " their lives on the line , " examines the persecution of activists and other champions of women 's rights not only by the @entity15 and tribal warlords , but also by government officials . its publication is timely . the brutal murder of @entity21 , a young woman in @entity7 , whose body was burnt and callously chucked into a river in @entity24 , shocked the world . accused of burning pages from the @entity29 holy book , the @entity28 , many protested the 27 - year - old 's innocence . but what also made international headlines was the fact that for the first time in history , women in @entity7 became pallbearers , hoisting the victim 's coffin on their shoulders draped with headscarves , under the gazes of men ; unreservedly sobbing and shouting messages of women 's solidarity as they marched along the streets . in a country ranked in 2011 by a @entity52 poll as the most dangerous place in the world for women , this feminist act seemed perilous . latest figures suggest they were risking their lives to be heard . in 2013 , the @entity58 in @entity7 ( @entity59 ) released statistics that showed the number of women killed in the country had increased by 20 % from the previous year , although the number of civilian victims had decreased , said @entity1 in the report . the special representative of the @entity58 @entity68 in @entity7 at the time , @entity67 , told the @entity69 that " the majority ( of women killed ) is linked to domestic violence , tradition , culture of the country . " women activists have been deliberately targeted . " and according to the human rights group , little support has come from those in power . " the @entity7 government has done very little to protect them , " @entity1 's @entity7 researcher , @entity82 , tells @entity2 . " perpetrators almost always walk free , and threats reported by women rights defenders are often simply ignored . " many women defenders we spoke to said that even when they received some protection from authorities , it was often significantly less than what male counterparts or colleagues were afforded . " during the attack on @entity21 , " many eyewitnesses have testified that police officers stood idly by while this woman was being lynched and killed , " says @entity82 . twenty - six people were arrested and thirteen police officials suspended in connection with the attack , but she argues that this is insufficient . " suspending police officers is not enough , those who failed in their duty must also be held to account -- anything less will just encourage further mob violence . " but what is striking is the resilience of the activists , who continue their work despite their lives being on the line . " it was a remarkable moment , " says @entity82 , recalling the female protesters at @entity21 's funeral . " unlike anything i have seen in my decades of campaigning for women 's rights in our country . " @entity122 , 32 , is a women 's rights activist and spokesperson for the @entity125 of @entity7 -- a small but outspoken political party based in @entity24 and twenty provinces that fights for issues such as democracy , social justice and women 's rights . the party was the first to be banned in the country for accusing @entity7 leaders and commanders of war crimes and demanding that they be brought to justice . taking part in @entity21 's funeral and protests against her death , she tells @entity2 that despite the onslaught of violence against @entity7 women over the years , this was the worst case . but the opportunity was taken to deliver a clear message . " so the women of @entity7 showed that we will not keep silent anymore ... and we are not ready to accept more brutality and violence against women , " said @entity122 . " so this is why we decided to carry the dead body of @entity21 on our own shoulders and show to the world that not only men can do it and somehow broke the traditionalism that ( a ) man has to do this job . " surprisingly , she says that male onlookers supported their mission , although they are in the minority overall in the country . " men ( at the funeral ) , they said you have to do this , because this is how you can change the hatred in @entity7 . " without men , it is not possible for women to get their rights , " she says . " so these men and women were working together . but at the same time , women need to step forward for their rights . " @entity82 says the fight for women 's rights was established a while ago . " women 's activism in @entity7 is nothing new -- the women 's rights movement has grown substantially since 2001 , and has fought for and achieved some very significant gains . " these gains are under threat now , however , and some are even rolled back . it 's essential that the government and its international partners do not allow this to happen . " ghaffer herself has been subject to threats because of her work , received through emails and phone calls , at her home and office . but she says she knew what she was getting herself into . " i knew it was n't an easy task . there might be many challenges and you have to lose your life when you are going and struggling for your rights . " as a woman , i want to struggle more ( for my rights ) , i want to have more people around me , to struggle with me . " @entity82 says it is too soon to talk about a revolution , although the response to @entity21 's killing , from both men and women , has been a " silver lining . " @entity122 , however , believes this is the beginning of an uprising -- but she says it needs to keep moving . interestingly , it was a man in her life that motivated her to fight . " i must say strongly that it was my father ( who inspired me ) , who is not any more with me , because he ... died three months ago , " she says . " he always told me that women always suffered in this country , " she says , her voice overcome with emotion . " and you have to struggle for your rights . because in this traditional , patriarchal society , nobody will give these rights ( to ) you . " she realizes how lucky she is , she adds , in a society where she has witnessed men -- fathers and husbands -- oppressing women as opposed to being their role models . @entity122 maintains that silence is an injustice to women , not least to the victim of the recent , horrific mob violence . " so if i should not do it , if another sister is not doing it , then who will do it ? who will get the rights for us ? we have to struggle for it . " if we keep our silence , more @entity259 will be killed in this country . "
