( @entity0 ) if one is to believe lawyers for @entity7 , the former @entity9 star had no conceivable reason to kill a man who was his friend , his future brother - in - law and a reliable purveyor of the marijuana he chain - smoked . the jury in the high - profile trial resumed deliberations wednesday after deliberating about an hour - and - a - half on tuesday . the way defense lawyer @entity16 laid it out for the @entity20 jury in closing arguments earlier tuesday , why would a young man with a $ 40 million contract kill semi-pro player @entity24 less than a mile from his own home ? why would @entity7 leave a marijuana blunt he shared with the victim at the murder scene ? did those who @entity16 described as inept and biased police officers and prosecutors simply become fixated with the former tight end with a promising future in the @entity34 ? " if there was evidence of any reason @entity39 would have had to murder @entity40 , do n't you think you would have heard about it in nine weeks ? " @entity16 asked the jury . " you did n't hear it because it does n't exist . " the prosecution , however , portrayed @entity7 as cold , calculating and insecure -- a man who believed others should be grateful for his attention , one capable of murder for merely disrespecting him in the presence of others . prosecutor @entity52 asked jurors : what was @entity7 talking about a day after @entity24 's bullet - riddled body was found at a @entity20 industrial park in june 2013 ? " ' my endorsements are gone , ' " @entity7 said , according to @entity52 said . " he 's not talking about @entity24 . " the state 's largely circumstantial case wrapped up after the testimony of more than 130 witnesses and the presentation of more than 400 pieces of evidence . on monday , @entity7 's defense gave its side of the story in less than a day . in closing arguments the next day , @entity16 sought to show that prosecutors failed to prove their contention that @entity7 orchestrated the killing without a reasonable doubt . even if they found a strong likelihood that @entity7 was involved , the lawyer said , " that 's not enough . " @entity16 tried to implicate @entity7 's co-defendants , @entity78 and @entity79 , who have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately . the defense described @entity78 and @entity79 as a pair of drug dealers known to become crazed while on @entity84 , as men capable of killing someone in drug - induced fits of rage . they 're accused of killing @entity24 . " did he make all the right decisions ? no , " @entity16 said of his client . " he was a 23 - year - old kid who witnessed something , committed by somebody he knew . he really did n't know what to do , so he put one foot in front of another . keep in mind , he 's not charged with accessory after the fact . ... he 's charged with murder ... and that he did not do . " the prosecution said @entity78 and @entity79 were longtime friends of @entity7 , who had complete control of them . @entity52 reminded the jury of testimony about @entity7 and his two friends sunbathing poolside hours after the slaying , drinking smoothies , and @entity7 at times leaving his then 8 - month - old child with the two men . " these guys ... will do whatever he wants , " the prosecutor said of @entity7 . the motive for the killing has never been clearly spelled out , but prosecutors said @entity24 might have done or said something that did n't sit well with @entity7 . they said @entity7 rounded up some friends and orchestrated the killing to settle the score . @entity52 said a perceived slight that might seem insignificant to someone -- such as disrespect -- would easily offend @entity7 . @entity7 's fiancee , @entity125 , testified that @entity7 told her to dispose of a box from the couple 's home that she said reeked of marijuana . she also said she did n't know what was in the box . the prosecution has said the murder weapon , which has not been recovered , was in the box . after concealing the box with her daughter 's clothing , @entity125 said she threw it away in " a random dumpster " but could not remember where . another piece of the state 's case was grainy footage from @entity7 's home security system that prosecutors said showed him holding a .45 - caliber handgun -- the same kind of gun police said was used to kill @entity24 . @entity7 could be seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after @entity24 was shot to death in the industrial park , which is about a mile from @entity7 's home . the video is time - stamped minutes after nearby workers described hearing noise they said sounded like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say @entity24 was gunned down after getting out of a car @entity7 was driving . @entity7 's lawyers showed a different part of the video time - stamped a few seconds earlier with @entity7 holding what appeared to be a shiny object in one hand . they suggested it was an @entity167 . evidence collected in @entity24 's death investigation led to two more murder charges against @entity7 in a separate case in @entity172 . @entity7 is also accused of shooting @entity173 and @entity174 , allegedly over a spilled drink at a nightclub . that double shooting took place in july 2012 , almost a year before @entity24 was killed . he will be tried in that case after the @entity24 trial . the jury has not heard about the double shooting . @entity0 's @entity183 and @entity184 contributed to this report .
