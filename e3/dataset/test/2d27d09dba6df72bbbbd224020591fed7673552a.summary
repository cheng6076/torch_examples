( @entity1 ) this week , @entity0 surprised the world yet again — not with the official launch of her campaign but for the unconventional way she did it*****1
she sure pushed the envelope*****0
with her video , new logo and road trip , she opened a long communications campaign not only to " rebrand " herself but to completely reframe who she is , what she stands for and how she intends to run*****0
we 'll find out over the next year and a half whether it will work*****0
many in the press and on late - night television scratched their heads this week ; others were scathing*****0
@entity21 -- a columnist for the @entity22 -- dismissed her launch video as a " relentlessly , insultingly vapid " effort of " demographic box - checking*****0
" @entity26 lampooned it as a " @entity29 commercial gone viral " and also " boring as s ---*****0
" since the media will likely be the stand - in primary opponent for @entity0 , their belief in her authenticity is a critical factor in whether she can reframe herself in voter 's eyes*****1
but from a marketing perspective , her launch may have been much more successful than critics think*****0
the @entity42 announcement video took on the central strategic challenge for the campaign and candidate : to flip @entity47 's message from self - absorbed " i " to empathetic " we*****1
" while critics may sneer , it is hard to deny that the image it projects of @entity0 is more confident , fresher , simpler and forward - looking , with even a bit of the upstart feel of two of the most successful product launch companies , @entity59 and @entity60*****1
@entity47 's team may have begun to create an empathetic relationship with voters that has eluded her in the past , most crucially when she lost the nomination fight to @entity66 in 2008*****1
in marketing terms , rebranding is a strategy to bring a new name , term , symbol or design to an established brand with the aim of developing a new identity in the minds of consumers*****0
reframing is a strategy that goes further : it seeks to change how a consumer ( or voter ) emotionally experiences an established brand*****0
a rebrand may change how you think about a brand ; a reframe may change how you feel about it*****0
in the @entity60 case , the company at one time fell on its face when it unveiled the original @entity93 ; some thought the company was headed for oblivion*****0
but when @entity97 returned as ceo , he went back to the drawing board and soon unveiled the @entity100 , which not only changed the way consumers thought about @entity60 , but how they experienced it*****0
not only a rebrand -- but a reframe*****0
take @entity0 's road trip to @entity106 in the van nicknamed @entity108*****1
the press lampooned her , but i would bet that for many others , her unscripted and anonymous stop at @entity112 reinforced the " everyday @entity115 " campaign theme*****0
@entity0 stood in line to order , an everyday customer among everyday people at an everyday fast - food chain*****1
also introduced last week was what will come to be the single most - ubiquitous element of her campaign : @entity47 's new and controversial campaign logo*****1
it is a brilliant , iconic expression of the emotional connection she wants people to have with her , her message and her movement*****0
in fact , her logo is all about movement*****0
simple , confident , high tech and shorthand to a much younger set of voters , the bold red arrow moving left to right in front of the strong blue @entity139 says it all : you are the important ones*****0
i 'm here to support you with everything i 've got*****0
let me help you move forward*****0
taken together , all the pieces of @entity47 's announcement -- as well as the unconventional media she used to deliver them -- bring her back on stage not as a leader from yesterday but , surprisingly , as one for the future*****1
coincidentally , the way @entity154 announced his run for the @entity157 nomination most likely amplified the impact of @entity47 's reframing*****1
for all his posturing about being the new generation , @entity154 followed to a " t " the most traditional script for announcing a candidacy : traditional stage and podium , dark suit , bright tie , wife and kids on camera , a live speech , all about himself , timed for the evening news*****0
@entity154 's logo , the signature of his image , drew immediate criticism for being amateurish and unconsidered , even leaving @entity179 and @entity180 off the map of @entity115*****1
in stark contrast , @entity0 showed the confidence and finesse to buck tradition on every front*****0
it was @entity0 who pulled the ultimate jiu - jitsu*****1
there are those , of course , who will be alienated , if not disgusted , by the way her campaign has unfurled such a sophisticated marketing plan*****0
in a day when voters are yearning for authenticity , how do we know this is the real @entity0 or a candidate in a mask ? fair question*****0
but for better or worse , mass marketing has become the staple of presidential campaigns -- that 's where most campaign dollars go*****1
both sides know how to play , sometimes brilliantly*****0
remember the @entity211 advertisements of 1984 , proclaiming " @entity212 " ? what we know is that over time , voters see a lot of unscripted moments of a candidate where the real character comes through*****0
and if they spot hypocrisy between ads and the candidate , that campaign will get into trouble fast*****0
that 's why the key to @entity0 's success in reframing her message and movement will be consistency*****1
she must not only take the essence of a humble , empathic relationship with voters and integrate it into all elements of her communication , she must also live it every day*****0
otherwise there will be messaging " schizophrenia , " the solid start with flashes of brilliance will peter out and she 'll be facing the same voter perceptions that doomed her race in 2008*****0
in the meantime , one can imagine @entity47 getting a huge , satisfying belly laugh out of the early returns on her efforts .*****0
