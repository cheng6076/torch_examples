( @entity1 ) considering the @entity2 celebrated its 50th anniversary on sunday night at the @entity5 stadium , it was bound to be bigger than any previous year 's @entity6*****1
plus , as hosts @entity8 and @entity10 were quick to point out , everything is bigger in @entity11*****0
@entity1 : 2015 @entity2 : see all the photos but bigger is n't always better*****0
here 's our breakdown of the 10 best and 5 worst moments at the 2015 @entity6*****1
the @entity16 @entity17 & @entity18 provide an opening wallop with a full stadium and millions of home viewers watching , two of country 's leading men successfully lit the fuse for the 50th annual @entity2 with a slick joint kickoff performance*****0
@entity17 's " pledge allegiance to @entity32 " was a fine throwback , but @entity18 's powerhouse " @entity29 " lived up to its title -- and then some*****0
setting a @entity33 not only was this the @entity6 biggest audience ever , but the 2015 @entity2 brought in the biggest audience for a live tv awards show ever*****0
now that 's how you celebrate half a century*****0
@entity39 demonstrates how it 's done during a night that found a couple performers sounding a little weak in the vocal department , @entity39 showed the entire @entity5 stadium -- and many younger singers who do n't have half her energy -- how it 's done*****1
@entity39 is eternal*****0
@entity48 singing in the audience whether it was during @entity17 or @entity51 , @entity52 was heating up the audience by singing and swaying along to country staples*****0
@entity48 might have gone pop for " 1989 , " but she was deep in the heart of @entity11 for this annual country extravaganza*****0
@entity1 : 2015 @entity2 : and the winners are ... @entity61 ' @entity60 salute during @entity61 ' performance of " @entity64 , " the country giant welcomed a slew of @entity67 military representatives into @entity68 , in an emotional moment that put the red , white and blue front and center*****0
@entity61 ended the performance by saluting the @entity67 armed forces " who are here and are all around the world for protecting our freedom , " and also shouted out his home state of @entity80 , who are grieving 20 years after the @entity83 bombing on sunday*****1
a truly classy moment from one of the best ever*****0
@entity48 's mom makes an appearance sure , @entity88 's presentation of a special award for her daughter came with a fun origin tale about the creation of " @entity93 " and some lovely words about the 25 - year - old superstar*****1
but the sight of the elder @entity52 -- just days after @entity48 confirmed that her mother had been diagnosed with cancer -- walking to the podium was more than enough to yield one of the night 's most poignant moments*****1
@entity102 joins @entity103 @entity102 is far from country , but with a voice as malleable as hers , she can pass for a song or two*****0
after singing a bit of the tune she did while guesting on @entity110 , @entity102 joined longtime hitmakers @entity103 for " riot " from their recent album " rewind*****0
" @entity102 and @entity115 trading vocals was the rare unexpected artist pairing that actually worked*****0
@entity118 domination in addition to kicking ass during her " @entity122 " / " @entity125 " medley , @entity119 justly owned the night when it came to awards*****0
if there 's one thing the country community loves more than @entity118 , it 's giving @entity118 awards*****0
@entity1 : watch @entity133 ' to @entity135 @entity133 do n't back down despite some mild controversy over their song " @entity133 , " @entity133 brought the poignant ballad to the awards show , giving the @entity6 one of its more melancholy moments*****1
@entity142 comes on strong for a night featuring some shaky vocals , @entity142 brought his silky yet powerful country croon to the @entity6 during a massive medley*****0
it 's hard to see an audience get weak in the knees when you 're watching at home , but it 's fair to assume that 's what happened during his performance*****0
the worst @entity156 the @entity5 qb was understandably a little stiff on the mic ( athletes usually are n't the most charismatic public speakers ) but the whole gag with @entity8 asking @entity156 to toss @entity10 a pass went on waaaaay too long*****0
on the plus side , @entity10 caught the pass*****0
on the other hand , there was a tired play on words about balls*****0
the length three hours for the 50th @entity6 ? sure , why not*****0
three and a half hours ? that 's pushing it*****0
they could have shaved off the last half hour by cutting a couple of the performers who only sang half a song , and shortened a few of the massive commercial breaks*****0
all of the @entity181 @entity48 was given an extended honor at this year 's @entity2 , but some of the @entity181 -- especially those given to @entity39 , @entity185 and @entity186 -- seemed rushed for the country giants they were saluting*****1
it 's understandable since 2015 is the 50th anniversary of the @entity6 , but sometimes , less ( recipients ) is more*****0
@entity192 's facial hair see link*****0
@entity194 calling out @entity48 plenty of country fans went after @entity48 on @entity194 , berating her for attending the @entity6 after " abandoning " country music for pop. the truth is , @entity48 has just as many country classics under her belt as any other artist in her age range*****0
she might have moved to pop , but do n't underplay her importance to the genre that birthed her*****0
