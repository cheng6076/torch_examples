in the past , that was not your usual showjumping and dressage atmosphere -- but that 's something the sport is trying to change*****1
hosting world - class horsesport in @entity9 is a way to raise its profile in the @entity82*****1
as with this month 's showjumping on @entity85 , the thinking is location , location , location*****0
for the riders , few locations are comparable*****0
" it 's like a @entity99 feel , " said @entity91 , one of the vegas organizers , describing how the bowl of the arena will seat spectators unusually close to the action*****0
showjumping comes here for the showbiz*****0
in previous years , trophies have been handed out by flying showgirls descending from the rafters*****0
elvis impersonators have burst into the arena on horseback*****0
this year , a " selfie booth " will let fans crowd in with leading riders for awkward photos on their phones -- and there will be quite some choice of riders*****1
