( @entity1 ) soon , @entity0 will be too fat to fight*****0
forget about rampant diabetes , heart attacks and joint problems -- the scariest consequence arising out of our losing battle with the bulge is the safety of our country*****0
in about five years , so many young @entity0 will be grossly overweight that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers*****1
that alarming forecast comes from @entity14 , gen. @entity15 , who is in charge of @entity17*****0
obesity , he told me , " is becoming a national security issue*****1
" i was so taken aback by @entity15 's statement that i felt the need to press him*****0
come on ! obesity ? a national security crisis ? @entity26 did n't blink*****1
" in my view , yes*****0

some did n't make the cut because they had a criminal background , or a lack of education , or too many tattoos*****0
but a full 10 % did n't qualify because they were overweight*****0
before you accuse me of sensationalizing , it 's that 10 % figure that worries @entity43 the most*****0

just look at the numbers : more than one - third of @entity0 adults are obese*****0
seventeen percent of all children and adolescents in the @entity0 are obese*****0
that 's triple the rate from just a generation ago*****0
so , maybe we should face the fact that we 've grown comfortable with our girth*****0
it is crystal clear we have n't the foggiest idea of who needs to lose weight and who does n't*****0
just the other day , @entity129 trolls scolded the singer , @entity130 , for gaining weight*****0
@entity130 is not remotely fat*****0
neither is @entity133 , haters*****0
or @entity135 , hecklers*****0
if 70 % of us are overweight in this country , why are there so many willing to fat - shame people who are not remotely obese ? maybe it 's easier to criticize others for carrying extra weight than to admit we have a weight problem ourselves*****1
because it is abundantly clear we are wallowing in denial*****0
