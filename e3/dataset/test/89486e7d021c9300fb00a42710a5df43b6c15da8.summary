@entity3 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) it is an unimaginably hideous outcome*****0
to be raped by your cousin 's husband ; be jailed for adultery as your attacker was married ; to suffer the ignominy of global uproar about your jailing and assault , but be pardoned by presidential decree ; and then to endure the shame and rejection from a conservative society that somehow held you to blame*****1
the solution in this society ? marry your attacker*****1
that 's what happened to @entity24 , who was barely 16 when she was raped*****0
she 's now carrying the third child of her attacker , @entity27 , who was convicted and jailed -- though this was then reduced*****1
@entity24 's plight -- like so much in beleaguered @entity1 -- disappeared from the world 's gaze once she was pardoned and released courtesy of a presidential pardon*****1
instead of a new start , what followed for @entity24 was a quiet , @entity1 solution to the " problem " -- a telling sign of where women 's rights stand in @entity1 despite the billions that have poured into this country from the @entity44 government and its @entity46 allies during more than a decade of war*****0
we found @entity24 in her family home*****0
smile , the name of the daughter born of the rape , is now a shining little girl , bouncing around the house that her mother shares with @entity27 's first wife -- who is also @entity24 's cousin*****0
@entity27 agreed to let us speak with him and @entity24 because , it seemed , he wanted to show us that things were now settled , that under @entity1 's version of social morality he had done the right thing*****0
he had rescued @entity24 from shame*****0
