( @entity0 ) feeling so happy you just ca n't stand it ? you might want to pop some acetaminophen . a new study has found that acetaminophen , the main ingredient in @entity10 , most forms of @entity6 and more than 600 other medicines , reduces not only pain but pleasure , as well . the authors of the study , which was published this week in @entity14 , say that it was already known that acetaminophen blunted psychological pain . but their new research led them to the conclusion that it also blunted joy -- in other words , that it narrowed the range of feelings experienced . " this means that using @entity10 or similar products might have broader consequences than previously thought , " said @entity24 , a doctoral student in social psychology at @entity26 and the lead author of the study . " rather than just being a pain reliever , acetaminophen can be seen as an all - purpose emotion reliever . " the researchers tested their thesis by showing 82 college students 40 photographs -- some of highly pleasant images , such as children with kittens , and some of highly unpleasant images , such as children who were malnourished . half of the participants in the study were given " an acute dose " of acetaminophen -- 1,000 milligrams -- and the other half were given a placebo with the same appearance . the subjects were then asked to rate the photos according to how unpleasant or pleasant they were . those who took the acetaminophen rated all the photos less extremely than those who took the placebo . " in other words , positive photos were not seen as positively under the influence of acetaminophen and negative photos were not seen as negatively , " the authors reported . the researchers followed up by testing a group of 85 people to see whether this change in judgment applied just to emotions or whether the drug blunted people 's evaluation of magnitude in general . this group showed the same blunting of emotional reactions . but acetaminophen did not affect how much blue they saw in each photo . but people who participated in the study did not appear to know they were acting differently , said @entity81 , an assistant professor of psychology who was another of the study 's authors . " most people probably are n't aware of how their emotions may be impacted when they take acetaminophen , " @entity81 said . each week , about 23 % of @entity89 adults -- or 52 million people -- use a medicine containing acetaminophen , according to the nonprofit @entity93 . the authors said it was not known whether other pain relievers , such as ibuprofen and aspirin , have the same effect . but have no fear -- they plan to study that question , as well .
