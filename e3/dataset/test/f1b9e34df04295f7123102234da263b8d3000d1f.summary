( @entity1 ) it 's clear from @entity3 's campaign rollout -- a video announcement / campaign ad / short film that debuted sunday afternoon -- that she will make women and being a woman central to her outreach . in case you 're skeptical , @entity8 has posted a handy " by the numbers " for her campaign video , and there are 38 people besides @entity14 in the two - minute ad . twenty of them are women . there are three separate mentions of motherhood . this is all fine and good ( and predictable ) if you acknowledge that the proportion of women who vote has exceeded the proportion of men who vote in every presidential election since 1980 . and let 's not overlook the fact that @entity14 is in fact a woman , and that 's a fine thing to celebrate . but in reality , she does n't have to wonder if a woman - centered campaign is the best strategy . she can simply look back to the most recent elections to see that overplaying to one half of the eligible - voting population failed spectacularly all over the country , in red and blue states , when that strategy was employed by both male and female candidates . as i 've previously written , the 2014 midterm elections saw the death of a political meme : the " war on women . " granted , that 's not because @entity50 convinced the country that they were the party of women . but it is noteworthy that @entity55 who overtly pandered to women at the expense of real issues ( and men ) crashed and burned . to wit : in @entity62 , sen. @entity61 was nicknamed " @entity68 " for all the time he spent fear - mongering on women 's reproductive issues , only to end up , according to exit polls , eight points ahead among women . his opponent , @entity69 , finished 17 points ahead among men . in @entity72 , a @entity55 candidate for @entity74 , @entity75 , drew laughs from the audience during a debate for accusing her opponent of engaging in a " war on women . " to repeat , she was a woman , a @entity82 , in @entity72 . in @entity84 , sen. @entity83 sought to give her ailing campaign a boost in by part blaming sexism for @entity55 ' lack of popularity in the @entity91 . not surprisingly , @entity91 voted for her opponent , @entity92 . in @entity93 , where liberal @entity94 ran almost entirely on an abortion - rights platform , she accused @entity50 of sexism for daring to scrutinize her inaccurate biography . her opponent , @entity99 , won by 20 points , and @entity101 only ended up with 47 % of the women vote . whether in @entity93 or @entity62 , @entity72 or @entity84 , voters made it clear they cared about more than just reproductive issues and were n't going to be bullied into voting @entity55 by false cries of sexism . but while @entity55 were screaming about the @entity50 ' " war on women , " few in the media acknowledged that the @entity55 ' deficit among men was actually greater than the @entity50 ' deficit among women . exit polls in 2014 showed that men voted for @entity50 over @entity55 by a 16 - point margin , and women voted for @entity55 by only a four - point margin . regardless of whom @entity50 run for president , @entity3 will most likely get the women vote . what she needs are men . so instead of running a woman - centered campaign , she might want to figure out a way to court the other sex .

in case you 're skeptical , @entity8 has posted a handy " by the numbers " for her campaign video , and there are 38 people besides @entity14 in the two - minute ad*****0
twenty of them are women*****0
there are three separate mentions of motherhood*****0
this is all fine and good ( and predictable ) if you acknowledge that the proportion of women who vote has exceeded the proportion of men who vote in every presidential election since 1980*****1
and let 's not overlook the fact that @entity14 is in fact a woman , and that 's a fine thing to celebrate*****0
but in reality , she does n't have to wonder if a woman - centered campaign is the best strategy*****0
she can simply look back to the most recent elections to see that overplaying to one half of the eligible - voting population failed spectacularly all over the country , in red and blue states , when that strategy was employed by both male and female candidates*****1

to wit : in @entity62 , sen. @entity61 was nicknamed " @entity68 " for all the time he spent fear - mongering on women 's reproductive issues , only to end up , according to exit polls , eight points ahead among women*****0
his opponent , @entity69 , finished 17 points ahead among men*****0
in @entity72 , a @entity55 candidate for @entity74 , @entity75 , drew laughs from the audience during a debate for accusing her opponent of engaging in a " war on women*****1
" to repeat , she was a woman , a @entity82 , in @entity72*****0
in @entity84 , sen. @entity83 sought to give her ailing campaign a boost in by part blaming sexism for @entity55 ' lack of popularity in the @entity91*****0
not surprisingly , @entity91 voted for her opponent , @entity92*****0
in @entity93 , where liberal @entity94 ran almost entirely on an abortion - rights platform , she accused @entity50 of sexism for daring to scrutinize her inaccurate biography*****0
her opponent , @entity99 , won by 20 points , and @entity101 only ended up with 47 % of the women vote*****0
whether in @entity93 or @entity62 , @entity72 or @entity84 , voters made it clear they cared about more than just reproductive issues and were n't going to be bullied into voting @entity55 by false cries of sexism*****0
but while @entity55 were screaming about the @entity50 ' " war on women , " few in the media acknowledged that the @entity55 ' deficit among men was actually greater than the @entity50 ' deficit among women*****1
exit polls in 2014 showed that men voted for @entity50 over @entity55 by a 16 - point margin , and women voted for @entity55 by only a four - point margin*****1
regardless of whom @entity50 run for president , @entity3 will most likely get the women vote*****0
