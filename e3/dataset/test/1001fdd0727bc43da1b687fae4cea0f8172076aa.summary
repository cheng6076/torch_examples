many reason that @entity3 's chaos is an opportunity : border posts are left abandoned , the coastline unguarded*****0
@entity158 make the journey for economic reasons ; the majority are single men in their twenties*****0
populations in the region are swelling but farmland and economic security shrinking*****0
often , say researchers , the oldest son leaves to find work so he can remit funds home -- perhaps misled by fables of riches*****0

@entity196 of the @entity55 says there 's also been an increase in the number of @entity201 @entity200 following this route , escaping the chaos and brutality inflicted on their towns and villages by @entity208*****0
another disturbing phenomenon , according to @entity88 , is the trafficking of @entity18 women for prostitution to @entity147 through @entity3*****0
while still a small fraction of the overall migration , the number of women smuggled for sexual exploitation in @entity5 rose threefold in 2014 , she says*****0
why migrants are risking their lives to reach @entity147 a @entity221 - based group , the @entity220 , estimated last year that about half of @entity18 migrants pass through the town of @entity225 in northern @entity226*****1
a crackdown in 2013 on organized convoys leaving @entity225 stemmed the flow for a while , but gangs from the @entity233 tribe , which controls the cross-border trade , developed new routes and raised their prices*****0

@entity251 has also been a destination for @entity12 refugees , but new visa requirements have forced them to seek other routes -- often through @entity258 and the @entity260 islands*****0
hundreds of thousands of other migrants have already been in @entity3 for years , attracted to jobs as day laborers when @entity264 was in power*****0

the arrival of the @entity325 in @entity326 and @entity12 ( @entity281 ) in @entity3 has further complicated passage ; in january jihadists killed 14 @entity3 soldiers near @entity300*****0
@entity88 detects a changing pattern since the @entity12 conflict began*****0
it has injected more money into the smuggling business , which has therefore become more organized*****0
the more reliable groups can charge more ; she says some migrants buy a " package " from smugglers that includes overland and sea travel*****0
@entity12 migrants are relatively better off than @entity341 , and may pay more to guarantee a place on the top deck of a vessel*****0
@entity184 are more often locked in the hold and are more vulnerable if a vessel sinks , or consigned to an inflatable dinghy*****0
