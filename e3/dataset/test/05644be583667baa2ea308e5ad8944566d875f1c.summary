( @entity1 ) five years after the @entity3 rig exploded and unleashed the largest marine oil spill in the nation 's history , we are still experiencing -- yet only beginning to truly understand -- its profound environmental and economic repercussions*****1
the immediate aftermath of the oil spill has been well documented , with declines in tourism and the seafood industry , as well as the significant destruction of wildlife in the region*****0
since then , the amount of oil in the area has dissipated and communities have started to show signs of recovery*****0
in fact , reports indicate that the @entity27 's seafood industry , which supplies the @entity29 with roughly 40 % of its seafood , is finally starting to rebound*****0
however , profound challenges remain , in part because so many questions about the long - term consequences remain unanswered*****0
to this day , it 's still unclear where all of the oil went , exactly how much remains or whether the reappearance of wildlife is a result of adaptation or a signal that the crisis is truly abating*****0
one of the populations that can provide insight into these questions is the @entity27 crab*****1
crabs play an important role in the region : roughly 60 million pounds were fished in the @entity27 in 2012 , earning tens of millions in revenue*****0
yet in the aftermath of the spill , changes to crustacean communities in the area were quite apparent to the naked eye*****0
researchers documented substantial differences in appearance , and deformities in crabs that were affected by the spill including lesions so numerous they ate through the joints , forcing limbs to fall off*****0
these traits have affected not only the crabs ' market value but also likely their ability to survive*****0
while these changes in outward appearance have dissipated in the short - term , the health of these crabs could still be precarious*****0
i have been working with colleagues at @entity79 and @entity80 to better understand what might be happening biologically inside the crab when it is exposed to oil and the dispersant used to respond to the spill*****1
using the power of genomics and computational biology , we analyzed the genes of flat back mud crabs that were exposed to oil from the @entity94 where the @entity3 rig was drilling when it exploded or to a combination of oil and dispersant in the lab. by studying gene expression , the process that turns information from a gene into a product that functions within a cell , we searched for indicators that might signal exposure to oil and , based on the types of changes we might see , clues as to how the crabs respond*****1
although we are still in the early stages of our research , we are seeing significant differences in gene expression connected to exposure -- meaning the crabs are turning some genes on or off in response to oil and dispersant*****0
we are still working to determine whether these changes impact their ability to survive and reproduce*****0
it 's not just @entity27 crabs that are experiencing changes*****0
research on different species and other aspects of the regional environment is starting to show that there could be long - term effects resulting from the oil spill and the response to the spill*****1
this not only has consequences for the @entity27 area , where oil drilling continues , but also for communities along the @entity138 , where the @entity140 administration has recently announced a plan to open unprecedented oil and natural gas exploration*****0
( @entity145 's vice president of communications , @entity144 , told @entity1 that wildlife species in the @entity27 have " bounced back and " there is no data that suggests there are any long - term population - level impacts to any species*****1
" ) with the virtual certainty of more spills , we need a lot more information on the consequences of these disasters and how we can combat them effectively and efficiently*****0
the @entity29 @entity160 and the @entity161 are making some progress*****0
in coming months , they are releasing changes to regulations and response plans based on the early lessons learned from the @entity3 spill*****0
but government agencies can not just rely on the short - term data to determine the best response for the next oil spill crisis*****0
instead , the government and oil companies should work together to support ongoing , long - term ecological research so that we have a better grasp of what " normal " looks like and what factors are important in maintaining those conditions even after a disastrous oil spill*****0
only then will we truly understand the impact of offshore drilling and the best ways to respond to crises to protect our most important natural resources .*****1
