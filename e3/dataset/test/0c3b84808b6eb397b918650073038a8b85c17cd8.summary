@entity1 ( @entity2 ) @entity0 says he 'd hoped @entity4 gov. @entity3 would veto the " fix " to his state 's religious freedom law rather than limiting its scope . the law unleashed an intense backlash against @entity4 , led by tech giants like @entity12 and @entity13 and sports organizations like the @entity15 , amid concerns it would allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers . @entity0 , the former @entity22 senator from @entity23 , who is likely to mount another presidential campaign in 2016 , said on @entity26 ' " @entity25 " on sunday that @entity3 's decision to sign a follow - up bill -- which made clear the law could n't be used to refuse services based on sexual orientation -- led to a " limited view " of religious freedom . " it does n't really open the debate up on some of the more current issues , " @entity0 said -- a reference to gay rights issues . with the @entity38 set to rule in june on whether same - sex marriage should be legalized nationwide , social conservatives like @entity0 have asserted that @entity41 bakers , florists and wedding photographers should n't be forced to provide their services to same - sex weddings . the @entity4 uproar drew nearly all of the @entity22 's 2016 contenders into the debate , with candidates like @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 rushing to @entity3 's defense . " tolerance is a two - way street , " @entity0 said . " if you 're a print shop and you are a gay man , should you be forced to print ' @entity59 hates fags ' for the @entity61 because they hold those signs up ? " @entity0 said . " should the government force you to do that ? " he said . " and that 's what these cases are all about . this is about the government coming in saying , ' no -- we 're going to make you do this . ' and this is where i think we just need some space to say , ' let 's have some tolerance -- have it be a two - way street . ' " gay rights groups , meanwhile , have used the outrage over @entity4 's law -- as well as a similar one that @entity87 gov. @entity86 signed into law -- and debate in at least 14 other states over similar measures this year to renew their calls for state laws that bar discrimination based on sexual orientation . @entity96 , the @entity97 's legal director , said the debate could shift to states like @entity100 and @entity101 , where similar bills have been introduced . she said tech companies like @entity104 and @entity105 are increasingly wading into the debate because they 're recognizing that " nondiscrimination protections are critical to every area of their employees ' lives . " cardinal @entity111 , the archbishop of the @entity113 archdiocese in @entity114 , said on @entity116 's " @entity115 " on sunday that the debate over religious freedom calls for a " delicate balance . " " we 've got to make sure that the rights of conscience and the ability to publicly exercise one 's religion is also balanced with another good -- namely , the rights of people not to be discriminated against , " he said . " it 's easier to ignore religious freedom than it is , today , the more popular issues , " @entity111 said .
