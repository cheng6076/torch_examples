( @entity0 ) there was a larger message in the article about a purported gang rape that @entity5 retracted on sunday night -- a part of the story that was never disputed : the @entity8 is under continuing investigation over how it handles sexual assault on campus . the school has never expelled a single student for sexual assault -- even when the student admitted to it . the @entity16 attorney general asked the law firm of @entity18 to take a look at how the university historically handled allegations of sexual assault by its students . that includes how @entity8 officials handled the allegations in the discredited @entity5 article by a student the magazine called " @entity30 , " especially since the school knew about the allegations for more than a year before the article came out . the alleged gang rape at a fraternity house was in 2012 , and @entity30 told the university about it the next spring . she started telling her story very publicly , including at a " take back the night " rally . but @entity41 police did n't hear about it until after a separate incident in the spring of 2014 , in which @entity30 claimed someone threw a bottle that hit her in the face . when a university dean arranged for her to talk to police about that alleged assault , she also told the story of the alleged 2012 incident . in both cases , police said @entity30 refused to cooperate and so they could not pursue the case . but more women came forward to talk about their experiences -- women whose stories were not as dramatic or horrific as @entity30 's . @entity5 's story opened up a conversation about the topic , and then women began coming forward to talk about a culture on campus that was not sensitive to victims . many women told @entity0 about a euphemism for the word rape used by other students on campus . they 'd call it a " bad experience . " others told @entity0 that there were fraternities with reputations for being " rapey " and for using date - rape drugs . that some judged who could come in based on the sluttiness of a woman 's outfit . and if a woman did report her rape , some women complained that the internal process did n't seem worth it if their abuser would n't be kicked out of school . @entity5 had a line in its original story : " @entity8 's emphasis on honor is so pronounced that since 1998 , 183 people have been expelled for honor - code violations such as cheating on exams . and yet paradoxically , not a single student at @entity8 has ever been expelled for sexual assault . " after the article published , @entity8 admitted this and instituted a zero - tolerance policy on sexual assault going forward -- although that policy was never defined , so it 's unclear what it means . when the story was deleted from @entity5 's website , that was lost . " you lose a lot of other people 's voices who were in that article , " said @entity107 , a survivor and @entity8 student , " and a lot of good things that could have come about . fixing problems with administration here and on our campus " -- and , she added , across the nationo . along with the @entity18 investigation , there 's also an open @entity126 investigation into @entity8 by the @entity128 @entity127 as a result of a civil suit . the attorney who filed the suit , @entity131 , told @entity0 that @entity8 medical staff lost or destroyed evidence from the alleged sexual assault victim he 's representing , making it impossible for her to move forward and get justice . when the @entity141 's 12,000 - plus - word critique is summed up , it really boils down to this : the mistake could have been avoided if the writer , @entity144 , had picked up the phone and made just a few more phone calls to the friends of @entity30 who she claimed were with her that night . they 'd later tell other media outlets , including @entity0 , that they remembered a very different story . @entity5 says their account would have been a red flag . and all three say they would have talked if they 'd been called . @entity155 , one of the trio , said he felt deceived by @entity30 , but he also pointed out that @entity144 's mistake in fact - checking was about one single incident , and the fallout has caused a much bigger issue to be lost .

( @entity0 ) there was a larger message in the article about a purported gang rape that @entity5 retracted on sunday night -- a part of the story that was never disputed : the @entity8 is under continuing investigation over how it handles sexual assault on campus*****1
the school has never expelled a single student for sexual assault -- even when the student admitted to it*****1
the @entity16 attorney general asked the law firm of @entity18 to take a look at how the university historically handled allegations of sexual assault by its students*****1
that includes how @entity8 officials handled the allegations in the discredited @entity5 article by a student the magazine called " @entity30 , " especially since the school knew about the allegations for more than a year before the article came out*****1
the alleged gang rape at a fraternity house was in 2012 , and @entity30 told the university about it the next spring*****0
she started telling her story very publicly , including at a " take back the night " rally*****0
but @entity41 police did n't hear about it until after a separate incident in the spring of 2014 , in which @entity30 claimed someone threw a bottle that hit her in the face*****0
when a university dean arranged for her to talk to police about that alleged assault , she also told the story of the alleged 2012 incident*****1
in both cases , police said @entity30 refused to cooperate and so they could not pursue the case*****0
but more women came forward to talk about their experiences -- women whose stories were not as dramatic or horrific as @entity30 's*****0
@entity5 's story opened up a conversation about the topic , and then women began coming forward to talk about a culture on campus that was not sensitive to victims*****1
many women told @entity0 about a euphemism for the word rape used by other students on campus*****0
they 'd call it a " bad experience*****0
" others told @entity0 that there were fraternities with reputations for being " rapey " and for using date - rape drugs*****0
that some judged who could come in based on the sluttiness of a woman 's outfit*****0
and if a woman did report her rape , some women complained that the internal process did n't seem worth it if their abuser would n't be kicked out of school*****0
@entity5 had a line in its original story : " @entity8 's emphasis on honor is so pronounced that since 1998 , 183 people have been expelled for honor - code violations such as cheating on exams*****1

fixing problems with administration here and on our campus " -- and , she added , across the nationo*****0
along with the @entity18 investigation , there 's also an open @entity126 investigation into @entity8 by the @entity128 @entity127 as a result of a civil suit*****1
the attorney who filed the suit , @entity131 , told @entity0 that @entity8 medical staff lost or destroyed evidence from the alleged sexual assault victim he 's representing , making it impossible for her to move forward and get justice*****1
when the @entity141 's 12,000 - plus - word critique is summed up , it really boils down to this : the mistake could have been avoided if the writer , @entity144 , had picked up the phone and made just a few more phone calls to the friends of @entity30 who she claimed were with her that night*****0
they 'd later tell other media outlets , including @entity0 , that they remembered a very different story*****0
@entity5 says their account would have been a red flag*****0
and all three say they would have talked if they 'd been called*****0
