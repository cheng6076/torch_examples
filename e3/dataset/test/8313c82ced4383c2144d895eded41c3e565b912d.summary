( @entity0 ) doing weird stuff to your body in the name of beauty is n't anything new*****0
humans have been changing the shape of our skulls , inking ourselves up and sticking things through various protuberances since before we figured out how to write*****0
but now we have @entity13 and @entity14 and hashtags , so these things seem to sweep around the world faster than a quick trip to the piercing joint*****0
and somehow , many trends these days seem to somehow involve a member of the @entity23 clan*****1
the latest : lip plumping*****0
by sucking on a jar*****0
to look like @entity25*****0
seriously*****0
it even has a hashtag : # @entity28 do n't worry , we said , " what the ... ? " too*****1
but , we are , after all , in the business of providing you , dear reader , with information about the news , events and trends that surround you*****0
so please read on to learn more about this and other " beauty " trends inspired by the @entity40 : used to be , @entity42 would teach the kiddos how to put on eyeliner or style their hair like a favorite star*****0
that 's so old - school*****0
now , the nets say you should stick your lips in a shot glass , suck all the air out and then pull it off to reveal your all - new plump kisser , just like @entity25*****1
except , well , see for yourself*****0
the hashtag # @entity28 has been trending on @entity13 in recent days , with posters showing off the often disturbing results of their efforts*****1
" made my chin look like a hickey a week ago and i 'll say iv never felt so dumb , " @entity13 user emmaburkie posted monday*****0
plenty of folks shared the sentiment*****0
many were people who 'd tried it*****0
others were just shaking their heads*****0
surgeon dr. @entity71 told @entity72 that the trend is dangerous*****0
" not only can significant pain , swelling , and bruising result from these suction techniques , but there is potential risk for scarring and permanent disfigurement with repeated attempts , " @entity71 said*****0
@entity25 has tweeted her disapproval of the lip - plumping trend she inspired*****1
it 's a trend that predates the @entity40 , but they certainly gave us a lot of it : the sideboob , the flash of breast from the side of a dress , shirt or just about anything else that can be draped on a woman 's body*****1
according to @entity102 , the arbiter of all things , search interest in sideboob has fallen off since its 2012 peak , when @entity104 dutifully reported " another day , another sideboob " shot from @entity23*****0
how about something newer ? surely you 've heard of the " belfie " ? a term reportedly coined by @entity23 herself , this charming practice -- a butt selfie -- involves posting self - photography of one 's posterior , thusly : the trend took off last year , with a deluge of broadcast butts and not a little derision , but may have reached its peak with the apparently real belfie stick -- a device for taking " perfect belfies simply and quickly*****1
