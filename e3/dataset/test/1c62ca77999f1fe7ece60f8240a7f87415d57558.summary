( @entity0 ) in @entity3 's tightly - managed democracy , where being an opposition politician can seriously damage your health , chances to question the country 's leader are rare*****1
president @entity8 cuts an isolated figure , closely guarded behind the walls of the @entity11 , traveling to - and - fro by helicopter or high - speed motorcade*****1
his almost daily appearances on state television often show him in formal meetings with subordinates , or visiting dignitaries*****0
interaction with ordinary @entity3 is usually carefully controlled and fleeting*****0
that is why this annual q&a session -- in which @entity8 will spend hours fielding questions from the general public on live television -- is such a widely anticipated event which provokes such excitement*****1
it is direct access to the @entity3 leader , or at least as direct as most @entity3 will ever get*****0
in recent years , sitting in a shiny studio surrounded by a hand - picked audience of soldiers , doctors , teachers , factory workers and so on , @entity8 has held forth on subjects from parenting to food prices , to relations with @entity39*****0
last year he spoke for three hours and 55 minutes*****0
in 2013 , it was a record - breaking 4 hours and 47 minutes*****0
organizers say this year , public interest is especially strong*****0
at one call center in @entity45 , where the public are encouraged to pitch their @entity8 questions , officials say more than 200,000 questions were submitted in the first hour after lines opened*****1
the @entity11 says they will have to sift through well over 1.7 million emails , video messages and texts to decide who gets to ask what on the big day*****0
a few would - be questions released ahead of the event give us a flavor of what 's on @entity3 's mind*****1
one man , who identifies himself as @entity62 from the @entity63 , asks : " @entity65 ( @entity8 's middle name ) , why are prices going up in the shops but wages are staying the same ? " sanctions and @entity3 's deep economic crisis , which saw the value of the @entity3 currency , the ruble , plunge in value by 50 % against the dollar , is set to be a major a theme*****1
so too is foreign policy*****0
with @entity45 at odds with the @entity82 over @entity83 , some of the released questions show how concerned ordinary @entity3 are about their country 's place in the world*****1
one unidentified schoolgirl asks : " is there a threat to @entity3 's interests from the @entity39 and @entity91 ? and will there be a new @entity93 ? " it 's not just @entity3 schoolchildren who want to hear @entity8 's answer*****1
critics of the @entity11 , of course , slam this entire event as @entity3 's imitation of democracy in action*****1
it 's hard to imagine a truly critical question , they say , getting aired on national television here*****1
in fact , its best not to look at this event as an opportunity for @entity3 to question their leader at all*****1
instead , it is more like a highly produced , highly choreographed chance for their leader to speak to them , and to the world*****0
sometimes , the @entity11 likes to throw in a nasty surprise , too*****0
last year saw @entity120 whistleblower , @entity119 , granted asylum in @entity3 , address @entity8 by videolink*****1
who knows who may pop up this time .*****0
