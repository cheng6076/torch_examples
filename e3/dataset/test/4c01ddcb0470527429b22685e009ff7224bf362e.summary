( @entity3 ) a jury of @entity2 's media peers has dissected the magazine 's disastrous , discredited story about rape on the campus of the @entity8 , and the emerging consensus is that @entity2 's lapses and sloppy blunders amount to journalistic malpractice -- made all the worse by the magazine 's head - in - the sand reaction to the thorough , devastating report released by a panel of investigators from the @entity19 . @entity2 's egregious mistakes of reporting and editing are regrettable but understandable . the magazine 's decision not to fire anybody or reorganize its newsroom operation is not . before the original story , " a rape on @entity31 , " was pulled from the @entity2 website , it registered 2.7 million hits following its publication in november -- more than any noncelebrity story in the magazine 's history . an anonymous undergraduate , given the name " @entity39 , " told @entity2 writer @entity40 she had been invited to a party thrown by @entity43 fraternity in 2012 -- only to end up beaten and gang - raped by seven boys , who were allegedly coached along in the attack by the same student , a casual acquaintance , who had invited @entity39 to the party . the horrific allegations sparked protests against the fraternity , a police investigation , the temporary suspension of all fraternities at the school and a nationwide debate about the prevalence of sexual violence on college campuses . but the story began to unravel almost immediately when @entity61 reporter @entity60 took a closer look , leading @entity2 to back away from the story and request a review by the @entity19 . that review , which is considerably longer than the original article , reveals startling lapses in basic journalistic practice . @entity2 writer @entity40 never verified the identity of the attacker and therefore never confronted him with the allegations ; she never spoke to three of @entity39 's friends who allegedly talked with @entity39 immediately after the attack , and she never gave the fraternity a fair chance to respond , refusing to provide specific information about what happened and when . and at every step of the way , when @entity39 began acting flaky -- refusing to provide basic information needed to verify her story or vanishing for weeks at a time without returning calls from the reporter -- neither @entity40 nor her editors or the magazine 's fact checkers made the hard but necessary decision to hit the pause button and decline to run the story . having worked part time as a journalism professor for a decade ( including one semester at @entity94 ) , i would agree with colleagues who call @entity2 's lapses the kind that would be unacceptable in a freshman classroom . i 've told students for years : you should never print allegations without giving people a fair chance to respond . and you should never take a source 's word about important facts without verifying the truth .

@entity2 's egregious mistakes of reporting and editing are regrettable but understandable*****1
the magazine 's decision not to fire anybody or reorganize its newsroom operation is not*****1
before the original story , " a rape on @entity31 , " was pulled from the @entity2 website , it registered 2.7 million hits following its publication in november -- more than any noncelebrity story in the magazine 's history*****1

the horrific allegations sparked protests against the fraternity , a police investigation , the temporary suspension of all fraternities at the school and a nationwide debate about the prevalence of sexual violence on college campuses*****0
but the story began to unravel almost immediately when @entity61 reporter @entity60 took a closer look , leading @entity2 to back away from the story and request a review by the @entity19*****1
that review , which is considerably longer than the original article , reveals startling lapses in basic journalistic practice*****0
@entity2 writer @entity40 never verified the identity of the attacker and therefore never confronted him with the allegations ; she never spoke to three of @entity39 's friends who allegedly talked with @entity39 immediately after the attack , and she never gave the fraternity a fair chance to respond , refusing to provide specific information about what happened and when*****1
and at every step of the way , when @entity39 began acting flaky -- refusing to provide basic information needed to verify her story or vanishing for weeks at a time without returning calls from the reporter -- neither @entity40 nor her editors or the magazine 's fact checkers made the hard but necessary decision to hit the pause button and decline to run the story*****1
