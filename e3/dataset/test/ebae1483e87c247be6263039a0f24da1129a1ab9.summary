" " on the issue of death penalty , we can have a long debate whether it is against human rights or it is morally wrong or right . that 's a whole other discussion , that 's a whole other argument , but what we 're saying now here is we are implementing our laws and we are adhering to our constitution that we have to protect our citizens abroad .
