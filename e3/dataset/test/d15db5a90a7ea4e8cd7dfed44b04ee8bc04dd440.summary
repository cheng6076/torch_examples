( @entity1 ) it wo n't come as news to anyone in @entity4 today that the authority to make an arrest carries with it the potential to escalate to lethal force . but the seemingly innocuous genesis of police authority ( initial stop and question , pulling someone over for a traffic violation ) becomes significant because of the potential result ( deadly force ) . a minor traffic stop can be the springboard to a check for outstanding warrants . an initial stop can therefore lead to an arrest . and an arrest , we know , can have fatal results . in @entity27 earlier this month , @entity26 was the subject of a bench warrant for over $ 18,000 in unpaid child support , according to court records . that means that once he was stopped , he probably knew before the police officer that his own arrest was a foregone conclusion . but failure to pay child support is not a crime . at least , not in the traditional sense , though states do criminalize it . it 's rightly a civil matter . skipping child support court should similarly not be a crime either . this means that a bench warrant for failing to appear in child support court is n't about catching criminals -- it 's bill collection , only with a collection agency bristling with lethal and other weapons , and acting under color of law . this raises some serious questions about what exactly we want our heavily armed law enforcement officers to be doing . not all " warrants " are created equal . sometimes there are warrants for arrest , which are issued for alleged murders , drug dealing or sexual assault . then there are cases like the @entity26 case . bench warrants for deadbeat dads are not arrest warrants for crimes . do n't get me wrong . deadbeat and absent dads are one of the most serious and often overlooked threats to our collective well - being today . forget the school - to - prison - pipeline . lousy parents are the prison pipeline ; particularly symptomatic of this problem are absent and deadbeat dads . still , given our justifiably dim view of deadbeat dads and child support court scofflaws , there is ultimately something dickensian in our remedy for enforcement . first , it 's important to keep in mind that nearly every instance of a family court 's intrusion into the private family unit is an undesirable event . yes , parents who ca n't resolve noncustodial support can turn to the courts , but once the courts and law enforcement are involved , they do things their way . and it almost always could have been avoided if the family could have resolved issues on their own . @entity27 family courts enforce their child support orders through civil contempt proceedings . oftentimes and sadly so , papa is a rolling stone , and he falls behind on his payments . when a supporting parent has fallen behind , the court clerk sends dad an order to show up in court and explain why he should not be held in contempt for violating the payment order . at the hearing , that parent may demonstrate that he is not in contempt by showing that , well , he would love to pay , but right now he 's just in the process of getting himself together -- and he actually has a job interview tomorrow or some variation of the well - established language of support shirkers . the bottom line is dad can try to demonstrate he 's too poor to pay his child 's support . if he fails to demonstrate this inability , the court may hold him in civil contempt and actually imprison him , unless and until he purges himself by making the required child support payments . what follows is typically a macabre combination of a telethon , a game show and debtor 's prison . the defendant calls friends and family to crowdfund his down payment to get out of jail . if he ca n't , he 'll be stuck in jail until he does pay . and let 's face it : while it 's hard to drum up a lot of sympathy for deadbeat dads , jailing someone for their debt makes it a little difficult to , you guessed it , earn money to pay that debt . of course , since getting yelled at in court or sent to jail is unpleasant , dads have a remarkable ability to forget about court or get dates " mixed up .

( @entity1 ) it wo n't come as news to anyone in @entity4 today that the authority to make an arrest carries with it the potential to escalate to lethal force*****0
but the seemingly innocuous genesis of police authority ( initial stop and question , pulling someone over for a traffic violation ) becomes significant because of the potential result ( deadly force )*****0
a minor traffic stop can be the springboard to a check for outstanding warrants*****0
an initial stop can therefore lead to an arrest*****0
and an arrest , we know , can have fatal results*****0
in @entity27 earlier this month , @entity26 was the subject of a bench warrant for over $ 18,000 in unpaid child support , according to court records*****1
that means that once he was stopped , he probably knew before the police officer that his own arrest was a foregone conclusion*****1
but failure to pay child support is not a crime*****1
at least , not in the traditional sense , though states do criminalize it*****0
it 's rightly a civil matter*****1
skipping child support court should similarly not be a crime either*****1
this means that a bench warrant for failing to appear in child support court is n't about catching criminals -- it 's bill collection , only with a collection agency bristling with lethal and other weapons , and acting under color of law*****1
this raises some serious questions about what exactly we want our heavily armed law enforcement officers to be doing*****0
not all " warrants " are created equal*****0
sometimes there are warrants for arrest , which are issued for alleged murders , drug dealing or sexual assault*****0
then there are cases like the @entity26 case*****0
bench warrants for deadbeat dads are not arrest warrants for crimes*****0
do n't get me wrong*****0
deadbeat and absent dads are one of the most serious and often overlooked threats to our collective well - being today*****0
forget the school - to - prison - pipeline*****0
lousy parents are the prison pipeline ; particularly symptomatic of this problem are absent and deadbeat dads*****0
still , given our justifiably dim view of deadbeat dads and child support court scofflaws , there is ultimately something dickensian in our remedy for enforcement*****1
first , it 's important to keep in mind that nearly every instance of a family court 's intrusion into the private family unit is an undesirable event*****0
yes , parents who ca n't resolve noncustodial support can turn to the courts , but once the courts and law enforcement are involved , they do things their way*****0
and it almost always could have been avoided if the family could have resolved issues on their own*****0
@entity27 family courts enforce their child support orders through civil contempt proceedings*****1
oftentimes and sadly so , papa is a rolling stone , and he falls behind on his payments*****0
when a supporting parent has fallen behind , the court clerk sends dad an order to show up in court and explain why he should not be held in contempt for violating the payment order*****0
at the hearing , that parent may demonstrate that he is not in contempt by showing that , well , he would love to pay , but right now he 's just in the process of getting himself together -- and he actually has a job interview tomorrow or some variation of the well - established language of support shirkers*****1
the bottom line is dad can try to demonstrate he 's too poor to pay his child 's support*****1
if he fails to demonstrate this inability , the court may hold him in civil contempt and actually imprison him , unless and until he purges himself by making the required child support payments*****1
what follows is typically a macabre combination of a telethon , a game show and debtor 's prison*****0
the defendant calls friends and family to crowdfund his down payment to get out of jail*****0
if he ca n't , he 'll be stuck in jail until he does pay*****0
and let 's face it : while it 's hard to drum up a lot of sympathy for deadbeat dads , jailing someone for their debt makes it a little difficult to , you guessed it , earn money to pay that debt*****0
of course , since getting yelled at in court or sent to jail is unpleasant , dads have a remarkable ability to forget about court or get dates " mixed up*****0
" the court 's remedy is to issue a warrant to bring dad to court*****0
that warrant is not technically a criminal arrest warrant , but it sure seems like an arrest warrant if dad gets picked up on a friday afternoon and has to wait in jail all weekend to see the judge on monday*****0
the point is this : some warrants are for the arrest of criminals*****0
those are the warrants we 're familiar with , from " @entity178 " and every other cop show*****0
other warrants , like those for contempt of a support order , have nothing to do with crime*****1
they 're bill collection and are essentially civil in nature*****0
yet we 've foisted that duty on the police as an ersatz collection agency*****0
that 's right , the same police charged with arresting dangerous criminals are also dragooned into bill collection for the courts*****0
when they run a driver 's name on a routine traffic stop and a deadbeat arrest warrant comes up , those same police who are armed with @entity205 and firearms are suddenly tasked with arresting a guy for failing to pay his bills*****1
not because he 's dangerous*****0
not because he 's a criminal*****0
because he 's ( breathtakingly ) financially irresponsible*****0
@entity26 might have run because he knew the drill*****0
he knew he was going to be arrested*****0
he should n't have run*****0
but he also definitely should n't have been shot*****0
if he owed $ 18,000 in arrears , he definitely should n't have been looking to buy a @entity214 , as his final words on tape at least seem to suggest he was planning to do*****0
but whether or not he ran , the result would have been the same : if he had a bench warrant , he was going to jail , by force if necessary , even though he does not appear to have committed a " crime*****0
" of course , the counterargument is : if we do n't arrest them , how else do we make deadbeat dads pay up ? there 's no easy answer*****0
but the better question may be : why do we as a society not shun parents who do n't take care of their kids ? social rejection can be an even stronger motivator than the threat of arrest*****0
arresting deadbeat dads is an extreme solution , and one that could be solved with less government intrusion , and more community involvement*****0
the @entity26 situation has highlighted some harsh truths*****0
if we continue to arrest and jail deadbeat dads , we ca n't be surprised when an armed police officer uses excessive and deadly force to arrest them*****1
while no one should be shot for failure to pay support , we 're also training police that a warrant is a warrant and an arrest is an arrest*****1
are we comfortable as a society using an armed police force , empowered to use deadly force , to aid in collecting these bills ? if we are , then we have to be comfortable with the possibility that a delinquent dad is going to bolt when he gets stopped for a broken taillight*****0
and if we 're comfortable with that , then we also have to be comfortable with the police giving chase , and making the arrest -- sometimes with whatever force they deem necessary in the moment*****0
then , our only defense is to watch*****0
and record*****0
note : an earlier version of this article did not make clear that states do make failure to pay child support a crime .*****1
