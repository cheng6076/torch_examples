( @entity2 ) just about now , @entity1 's enigmatic ruler was expected to be preparing to emerge from his fortified country for a visit to @entity5 to join celebrations next week marking the 70th anniversary of the end of @entity9*****1
the trip was highly anticipated*****0
after all , this was to have been @entity13 's first official international trip since he came to power in 2011 following his father 's death , and it would have provided a fascinating opportunity for the world to get a closer look at a young leader and a regime still largely shrouded in mystery*****1
but this week , @entity24 announced that the trip had been canceled , with @entity26 spokesman @entity25 saying thursday that @entity5 was informed via diplomatic channels that the trip would not happen*****1
he said that " the decision is connected with @entity1 domestic affairs*****0
" what could have changed @entity13 's mind ? it is practically impossible to answer the question with absolute certainty , but a possible explanation is that @entity13 may not be feeling completely secure in his position*****1
and nervous dictators prefer to stay home*****0
true , @entity13 runs one of the most brutally repressive regimes on @entity41*****0
and there is unceasing public praise for the younger ' dear leader , " including frenzied eruptions of support*****0
but these eruptions are carefully scripted , and those who have managed to flee the @entity1 confirm that in private , many are unhappy with the regime*****0
perhaps with the potential threats in mind , @entity13 feels the need to reassert his authority and keep his eye on the centers of power*****1
in 2013 , @entity13 shocked the country and stunned outside observers when he ordered the killing of his uncle , @entity61 , who had stood by his side from the day his father died*****0
@entity61 had mentored and guided the young @entity13 as he took the reins , but the once - powerful @entity61 was arrested by soldiers during a @entity68 meeting who dragged him away in a chilling scene broadcast on national television*****0
the central news agency called @entity61 a " traitor for all the ages , " with vague accusations that he had behaved " insolently*****0
" more seriously , he was accused of " counter-revolutionary factional acts in a bid to overthrow the leadership*****0
" and just this week , and only a day before the @entity24 announced @entity13 's canceled travel plans , a @entity80 lawmaker revealed that @entity80 's @entity82 had pieced together information suggesting that so far this year , @entity13 has ordered the execution of 15 senior government officials*****1
according to @entity80 legislator @entity87 , @entity1 's vice chairman of the @entity89 , for example , was executed because he objected to plans to change the design of a new government hall from a rounded shape to one resembling a flower*****0
such an explanation is bizarre*****0
and in keeping with the odd behavior we have grown accustomed to hearing about from @entity1*****0
but there may be more to this*****0
@entity13 -- who was still in his 20s when he took power and holds a host of titles , including supreme commander of the @entity107 -- still finds it necessary to remind everyone at home that he is the one in charge*****0
but although there is something almost comical about the explanations offered up by @entity1 for the actions of its regime , a nervous , unpredictable , inexperienced leader with access to nuclear weapons is far from a laughing matter*****0
as recently as 2013 , @entity1 conducted a nuclear test -- the country 's third , and it has threatened to use them against @entity80 , @entity126 and the @entity127*****0
meanwhile , it has threatened @entity80 with " final destruction , " said it will turn the country 's presidential office into a sea of fire , told @entity126 it would trigger a nuclear attack if @entity135 followed through on a warning to destroy any @entity1 missiles fired in its direction , and declared the @entity127 is seeking a war and that @entity144 " will be exercising our right to preemptive nuclear attacks*****0

@entity1 has been mostly out of the news in recent months , partly because so many other international crises have pushed it out of the headlines*****0
but that does n't mean tensions have eased*****0
just three weeks ago , @entity144 fired missiles into the sea as @entity127 defense secretary @entity162 arrived on the @entity163*****0
all this suggests that gauging the state of mind of the @entity1 leader is no easy task*****1
but if @entity13 raises the alarm about threats from the outside , we will know he is likely feeling insecure at home and may be trying to boost internal support*****0
that would be a danger sign for the people of @entity1 -- and a flashing red light for the rest of the world*****0
