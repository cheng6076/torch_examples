@entity2 , @entity3 ( @entity1 ) @entity0 and @entity4 met in college . it was n't the most romantic setting -- a study group for calculus - based physics -- but @entity0 managed to turn it into a story worth telling by cheating . " i set up a study group and ended up telling the other people not to come so it would be just the two of us , " said @entity0 with a smile . " he was sneaky , " says @entity4 . " yeah , i wanted to meet her , " says @entity0 , " and that was the best way i could figure out . " fast - forward eight years to 2014 . @entity0 , now 34 , and @entity4 , a newly minted 30 - year - old , were married and raising little @entity22 , 3 , and baby @entity23 , 3 months , in @entity2 , @entity3 , when life suddenly turns upside down . " i thought it was sciatica , " @entity4 says of the back pain and the " odd " feeling that prompted her to go to the hospital . " but i could n't get the doctors in the er to pay attention . so i went back the next day and told them that i was incontinent , and they did an mri and there it was . " " it " turned out to be an intramedullary glioblastoma , a highly aggressive form of brain cancer . @entity4 's version was extremely rare because it was lodged in her spine instead of her brain . " so it 's actually tangled into the spinal cord itself , " @entity0 explains . " if you 'd imagine a meatball inside of bunch of spaghetti , you ca n't just easily take it out without damaging a bunch of the spinal cord itself . " surgery removed 75 % . the rest was treated with a combination of oral chemo and radiation . but suddenly a second spot above the first grew worse and the area of radiation had to be broadened . after a week of treatment , @entity4 suddenly lost feeling in her legs . unfortunately , the numbness became permanent . before long , @entity4 was paralyzed from the belly button down . but that did n't stop her fighting spirit or her sense of humor . @entity4 nicknamed her tumors and decided to " terminate " them . " you pronounce it as ' tumah tumah - nator , ' " @entity0 says . " like how @entity72 would say it if he had a tumor . " as @entity4 continued to fight and improve , in august 2014 , @entity0 got some terrible news . the @entity77 lymphoma he had fought and battled into remission when he was 20 had reappeared . and it probably had been hiding in his body for a few years , making it extremely hard to overcome . " i thought it was never a concern again , " @entity0 says . " the procedures i went through , having a bone marrow transplant , i thought there would n't be any issues . it 's been over 15 years . it caught everyone completely off guard . " @entity0 was slated for a clinical trial with an experimental drug , but his alkaline phosphate levels were too high to meet the requirements . with no other options in the @entity96 , @entity97 or @entity98 areas , he is now on generalized chemotherapy , hoping it will force the cancer into remission so he can undergo a bone marrow transplant . two donors have been found that are a perfect match , if the cancer will respond . " as it goes on , they are saying it 's getting harder and harder to treat , " he says . " it 's just like a car picking up speed . eventually you 're going to have 5 million cells , it 's just going to keep growing and growing . " suddenly , both parents were undergoing the nausea , fatigue and discomfort of chemotherapy while trying to raise two small children . " some days it does feel like a battle , " @entity0 admits . " the days you are feeling absolutely horrible you do n't even want to get out of bed , but you know you have to because you have to take care of the girls or help @entity4 . some days it 's just way tougher than others . " friends and family became critical to the family 's success , taking over updates to the family 's online journal , and running fundraisers for medical expenses and building supplies to make the house wheelchair - friendly . " we 'd had an amazing support group , " @entity0 says . " @entity143 has friends from high school who will drop everything to help us out at a moment 's notice . and the community , it 's just amazing for people to help that much . " " even outside of our community , people we do n't even know , " adds @entity4 , wiping a tear from her eye . " we 've had care packages sent from @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 . it means a lot . " this january came the worst news yet . @entity4 's cancer , which had retreated from her spine , suddenly appeared in her brain . three tumors . @entity167 . what is @entity4 's reaction ? " i 'm not giving up , " she says . " @entity0 and i have a long road ahead of us . we know it 's going to be hard , but we 're going to do it . " " for me it 's just something that you have to do , " @entity0 says . " you have to fight it and you have to beat it because there is no option . " @entity22 , who is 4 years old now , and @entity23 , 1 , will have a home with @entity0 's brother if the worst is to happen , and friends are setting up fundraisers for the girls ' education . but that 's not the focus of @entity0 and @entity4 's fight . they want to get well . " yeah , we have two little ladies we have to take care of , " @entity4 says , " and lots of family and friends that care about us . " " she 's not just doing it for herself , she 's doing it for her whole family , especially her girls and her husband , @entity0 , " said @entity198 , @entity4 's older brother . " she 's not going to ever give up . what we really need is hope . " the @entity207 would like help finding clinical trials to address the rare cancers they are fighting , as well as access to cancer centers with more advanced techniques than are available in @entity3 . " we 're going to get all of our information and would like to go to @entity216 or @entity217 ( @entity218 ) or places where maybe they do have more experience , and act in a shorter time frame , " @entity4 says . " if , right now , we can find two or three trials that maybe @entity4 can get into , or a trial drug for me to try instead of the path i 'm on right now , it could definitely benefit us , " adds @entity0 . " we just ca n't wait , " @entity4 says . her prognosis is about six months , she says , and a year for her husband . " never give up , because there 's no reason to . just keep fighting , " @entity4 says . she breaks into tears : " especially when you have someone special to fight for and everyone has someone special to fight for -- there 's no one who does n't .
