( @entity0 ) on the stage of a tv studio in @entity3 , @entity5 @entity4 is telling an engrossed audience a tragic , but familiar , story . on april 17 , 1975 -- 40 years ago today -- life as @entity4 knew it was shattered when her hometown , the @entity13 capital of @entity3 , fell to the genocidal @entity15 regime of the @entity16 . @entity4 , then 13 , was separated from her mother and two of her sisters who , along with virtually the entire population of @entity3 -- about two million people -- were sent on a forced march into the countryside to work . @entity4 never saw them again , nor learned what happened to them . but about 20,000 people died from execution , starvation or exhaustion during this exodus at gunpoint , according to war crimes prosecutors ; the others were subjected to slave labor in rural camps once they reached their destination , where many met similar fates . the urban evacuation marked the first phase in the @entity15 's revolutionary program of social engineering , intended to establish a new order -- free of money , family ties , religion , education , property and foreign influence . aimed at creating an agrarian utopia , it would instead prove one of the worst genocides of the modern era , resulting in the deaths of at least 1.7 million @entity13 -- about a quarter of the country 's population -- over the next four years . @entity4 remained in the capital with her father and four other siblings , three of whom would succumb to starvation and disease in the following years , before her father was shot to death before her eyes in 1979 . his killing prompted @entity4 to leave her sole remaining family member , youngest sister @entity70 , in the care of a local couple . she set out on her own , making her way to a refugee camp and eventually to the @entity75 . for more than 30 years she has wondered what happened to her baby sister . " i think she was the only family member to survive , " she says , with tears in her eyes . as she finishes her story , the producers usher a woman on the stage . it 's @entity70 . @entity4 embraces her sister and both women sob . " i missed you so much , " @entity4 says . " i 've always searched for you , " @entity70 tells her . since production began five years ago , the television show , " it 's not a dream , " has reunited members of 54 @entity13 families shattered by the genocide . more than 1,500 have sought its help . the series is just one example of the ways in which @entity13 's traumatized society is beginning to undertake the fraught , painful business of reckoning with their history . " the scars of the @entity15 are very deep and physical and present in modern @entity13 , " said @entity103 , a human rights lawyer whose parents were killed by the regime , and who moved to the @entity75 as a refugee before returning to her homeland as an adult . she described the country as a " land of orphans . " for decades after the @entity15 were driven from @entity3 by @entity119 - backed @entity118 forces in january 1979 , the regime 's crimes were seldom spoken about , let alone attempts made to seek redress for victims . in large part , this was because people remained scared , say experts . far from being snuffed out by the @entity118 invasion , the @entity15 existed for another two decades . after fleeing the capital in 1979 , @entity15 leader @entity128 and his supporters established a stronghold in the west . they continued as an insurgent guerrilla force and became part of a government - in - exile that , until 1990 , was recognized by the @entity137 as the country 's only legitimate representative . " in many villages , people have been living side by side with the executioners for decades , " said @entity140 , executive director of the @entity141 . @entity147 , a @entity13 expert at the @entity148 at @entity149 , said that " for many years , there was a virtual taboo on even speaking of the @entity15 , as if the very words were ... a malevolent spirit lurking in the corner of every room . " the silence was also due to the fact that @entity13 , in @entity103 's words , " lacked the vocabulary " of therapy and healing to process a crime of the magnitude of the one perpetrated against their society . the @entity15 's attempts to reboot society at " @entity168 " had involved a concentrated effort to exterminate the country 's educated classes -- doctors , lawyers , accountants , engineers , merchants and clergy . " nearly two generations of young @entity13 men grew up learning little more than how to kill , " said @entity147 . " when it was finally time to rebuild , there were effectively no bootstraps with which the country could pull itself up again . " even today , said @entity184 , young @entity13 are not taught about the genocide in high school . in an impoverished country -- one of @entity190 's poorest , albeit with 7 % predicted economic growth this year -- most young people seemed to be focused on getting ahead than looking back , she said . some were even skeptical that the @entity15 's crimes -- the systematic butchery of the " killing fields " -- had really occurred , she added . the space for discussing , redressing and healing from the genocide only began to open up in the past decade with the establishment of the @entity201 , said @entity103 . founded in 2006 , the @entity201 in the @entity202 ( @entity201 ) is a " hybrid " tribunal using both @entity13 and international judges and staff to investigate the @entity15 's crimes against humanity and bring leading regime figures to justice . intended as a southeast @entity190 equivalent of the @entity211 , the tribunal , which has cost $ 232 million so far , initially enjoyed broad support .
