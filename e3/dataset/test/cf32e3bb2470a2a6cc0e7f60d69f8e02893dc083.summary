@entity1 , @entity0 ( @entity2 ) the questions @entity0 asked on tuesday were tinged with fear . " what 's going on ? what happened ? why ca n't i get into the subway ? " asked an elderly woman in a white headscarf with several shopping bags as she stood outside the barricaded entrance to one of @entity1 's busiest subway stations . she was one of millions of @entity0 left confused and concerned by the worst power outage to grip the country in more than a decade . dozens of cities across @entity0 lost power for hours on tuesday . millions of people were affected , including passengers stranded on paralyzed trains and subways . municipal workers were forced to evacuate @entity1 's @entity24 , where the black - out left commuters trapped deep beneath the rushing waters of the @entity28 . more than 24 hours later , @entity0 officials were still at pains to explain the power outage . the energy minister suggested a possible failure in transmission lines . the prime minister did not rule out the possibility of a terror attack . the mysterious collapse of much of the country 's energy grid triggered a burst of wild conspiracy theories across social media . some @entity45 users went so far as to suggest the black - outs were a warm up for elections scheduled to take place in june . there is fertile ground for rumor - mongering in @entity0 . over the last five years , security forces have arrested hundreds of army generals , journalists , prosecutors , civil society activists and police commanders and accused them of being members of assorted plots aimed at toppling the government . the government 's increasingly heavy - handed repression of public dissent , combined with overt censorship of the media and the internet , have also contributed to a hyper - polarized and deeply mistrustful political atmosphere . even @entity0 's veteran deputy prime minister , @entity68 , recently observed that opposition supporters now look at him " with hatred " rather than the grudging respect he enjoyed when his political party first swept to power in elections in 2002 . meanwhile , mysterious black - outs are a sore spot for some @entity0 , after a surreal 2014 incident on election night -- allegedly involving a feline saboteur . that is -- a cat that allegedly wandered into a power transformer . that was almost exactly a year ago , a smaller series of power outages affected some polling stations during nationwide municipal elections , prompting unsubstantiated accusations of vote rigging . the ruling @entity90 ended up winning by a comfortable margin , but few @entity0 were reassured by the energy minister 's explanation that the voting day black - outs were caused by a cat getting lost . as electricity was just starting to come back on in @entity1 on tuesday , a second crisis erupted . websites linked to an extremist leftist militant group known as the @entity100 began publishing chilling photos of a masked man holding a pistol to the head of a hostage in front of communist flags . two gunmen had somehow infiltrated the @entity109 , the monolithic court house in the center of @entity1 . there they took hostage @entity113 , the prosecutor in charge of one of the most politically sensitive trials in the country . the gunmen demanded the confessions of police officers accused of shooting a tear gas canister at @entity123 , a 15 - year - old boy who was critically wounded during anti-government protests that raged across @entity1 in 2013 . the boy 's death after months in a medically - induced coma triggered a fresh burst of protests and riots against the government . on tuesday , in the midst of the hostage crisis at the court house , the @entity0 government imposed a gag order banning broadcasters from reporting on the @entity109 . the broadcast ban is a measure that the @entity0 government has repeatedly used in recent years to stifle reporting on deadly terrorist attacks . the government also famously shut down @entity45 and @entity143 in an effort to kill highly embarrassing political scandals involving corruption . ultimately , tuesday 's court house siege ended in a deadly hail of bullets that left both gunmen dead and the prosecutor mortally wounded . @entity0 officials say special forces raided the court house only after the militants began shooting . online and in the streets , some @entity0 began linking the massive electricity blackouts to the hostage - taking inside one of @entity0 's best - protected buildings , even though there is little to suggest the two incidents are connected . just hours after the shooting , tensions exploded yet again at the court house . @entity1 's police chief had called for a press conference . as journalists jostled their way through security at the entrance to the largely deserted courthouse , some bystanders began chanting " government thieves .

@entity1 , @entity0 ( @entity2 ) the questions @entity0 asked on tuesday were tinged with fear*****0

the mysterious collapse of much of the country 's energy grid triggered a burst of wild conspiracy theories across social media*****0
some @entity45 users went so far as to suggest the black - outs were a warm up for elections scheduled to take place in june*****0
there is fertile ground for rumor - mongering in @entity0*****0
over the last five years , security forces have arrested hundreds of army generals , journalists , prosecutors , civil society activists and police commanders and accused them of being members of assorted plots aimed at toppling the government*****0
the government 's increasingly heavy - handed repression of public dissent , combined with overt censorship of the media and the internet , have also contributed to a hyper - polarized and deeply mistrustful political atmosphere*****0
even @entity0 's veteran deputy prime minister , @entity68 , recently observed that opposition supporters now look at him " with hatred " rather than the grudging respect he enjoyed when his political party first swept to power in elections in 2002*****1
meanwhile , mysterious black - outs are a sore spot for some @entity0 , after a surreal 2014 incident on election night -- allegedly involving a feline saboteur*****0
that is -- a cat that allegedly wandered into a power transformer*****0
that was almost exactly a year ago , a smaller series of power outages affected some polling stations during nationwide municipal elections , prompting unsubstantiated accusations of vote rigging*****0
the ruling @entity90 ended up winning by a comfortable margin , but few @entity0 were reassured by the energy minister 's explanation that the voting day black - outs were caused by a cat getting lost*****0
as electricity was just starting to come back on in @entity1 on tuesday , a second crisis erupted*****0
websites linked to an extremist leftist militant group known as the @entity100 began publishing chilling photos of a masked man holding a pistol to the head of a hostage in front of communist flags*****0
two gunmen had somehow infiltrated the @entity109 , the monolithic court house in the center of @entity1*****0
there they took hostage @entity113 , the prosecutor in charge of one of the most politically sensitive trials in the country*****1
the gunmen demanded the confessions of police officers accused of shooting a tear gas canister at @entity123 , a 15 - year - old boy who was critically wounded during anti-government protests that raged across @entity1 in 2013*****0
the boy 's death after months in a medically - induced coma triggered a fresh burst of protests and riots against the government*****0
on tuesday , in the midst of the hostage crisis at the court house , the @entity0 government imposed a gag order banning broadcasters from reporting on the @entity109*****1
the broadcast ban is a measure that the @entity0 government has repeatedly used in recent years to stifle reporting on deadly terrorist attacks*****1
the government also famously shut down @entity45 and @entity143 in an effort to kill highly embarrassing political scandals involving corruption*****0
ultimately , tuesday 's court house siege ended in a deadly hail of bullets that left both gunmen dead and the prosecutor mortally wounded*****0
@entity0 officials say special forces raided the court house only after the militants began shooting*****0
online and in the streets , some @entity0 began linking the massive electricity blackouts to the hostage - taking inside one of @entity0 's best - protected buildings , even though there is little to suggest the two incidents are connected*****1
just hours after the shooting , tensions exploded yet again at the court house*****0
@entity1 's police chief had called for a press conference*****0
as journalists jostled their way through security at the entrance to the largely deserted courthouse , some bystanders began chanting " government thieves*****0
" just hours after a devastating lapse of security at the @entity109 , police began detaining the demonstrators hurling abuse at their elected government*****0
the reactions to tuesday 's bewildering series of events revealed several truths about contemporary @entity0*****1
the country is tense and confused after years of back - to - back political crises*****1
heavy - handed censorship has left the mainstream media widely distrusted and discredited by broad segments of society*****0
and the absence of a common , credible space for sharing information has pushed critics of the government to the fringes of social media*****1
amid the burst of optimism and civil society activism in the early heady days of the @entity201 in 2011 , @entity0 was often cited as a possible democratic model for countries in the @entity204*****1
many of those @entity207 countries have since descended into conflict , repression and instability*****0
in the meantime , @entity0 feels increasingly vulnerable to demons of its own making .*****0
