" there 's nowhere to sleep , there 's no food -- you can see how people are just thrown around all over the place , " she said*****0
@entity8 is from @entity27 in @entity28*****0
her family is among the dozens of @entity29 caught in the crossfire of warring parties in @entity32*****1
and although many other countries evacuated their citizens , @entity33 most notably ferrying out around 5,000 , the @entity29 has said it is too dangerous for them to directly evacuate @entity29 nationals*****1
for more than three weeks , neighboring @entity38 has been conducting airstrikes in @entity32*****0
they want to drive out the @entity42 rebels , whose opposition to the government grew from protests to a takeover of government buildings and some territory*****0

it was purely coincidence that led to @entity8 being on board this ship , a wooden vessel chartered by @entity3 to reach the port city of @entity54 , in @entity32*****0
@entity8 was visiting her sick father in @entity54 when fighting broke out around her*****0
with the @entity42 forces to the north and the waters of the @entity113 to the south , the city is essentially besieged*****0
it took us over 30 hours of travel -- and a lull in the fighting -- for us to be able to dock at one of @entity54 's smaller ports*****0
she has a " nice , normal life " in @entity28 and said she could n't wait to get back*****0
our ship was the first the port had seen in over a week*****0
we agreed to take back 60 refugees -- including 15 @entity29 -- who had gathered at the port 's gate when news of our arrival spread*****0
but of course that 's nowhere near enough*****0
so many more are desperate to leave*****0

mothers and fathers*****0
daughters and sons*****0
the first night on board our boat had an almost festive air*****0
our new passengers were laughing and sharing cigarettes , euphoric at their escape*****0
one woman though was sitting alone on deck and i realized she was crying*****0
she told me her 15 - year - old son was trapped on the other side of one of the many front lines that are now etched into the city 's streets*****0
they 'd waited for 10 days , but neither her son nor her parents could cross over to the port , in @entity175 district*****0
too scared to risk missing the boat and endangering the lives of their other three children , her husband had convinced her to board*****0
when they called to tell her son he also had news for them : he 'd joined the fight against the @entity42 forces*****0
for @entity8 , her ordeal ended at @entity190 where @entity191 , the @entity29 deputy chief of mission , was among the embassy staff waiting to meet them*****0
i asked @entity191 about the sense of abandonment @entity8 and many of the other @entity29 trapped in @entity32 said they felt*****1

in this time of crisis , the $ 300 - a - person fee was n't an official tax , but something that local fishermen were charging to ferry passengers to the boat to board*****0
that 's 75 more families waiting for another happy coincidence to dock at @entity54 's deserted ports .*****0
