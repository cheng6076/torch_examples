she could see the ground splitting apart beneath her feet*****0
what scared her most was seeing large boulders crashing down from the mountains above*****0
she prayed she would n't be crushed*****0
she ran from the toppling boulders and shielded herself*****0
when the tremors subsided , @entity54 and her friends huddled together and camped on higher ground overnight , expecting to be rescued*****0
when three days passed and no one came to their aid , the group decided to take their chances and leave the confines of the resort*****0
the walk toward @entity80 was treacherous*****0
the roads near the resort were mostly blocked or in bad shape because of a landslide*****0
but the worst part was the smell of rotting flesh , which permeated the air as she passed countless villages flattened by the quake*****0
" it was a walk of survival , " she said*****0
" my brain refused to feel anything apart from putting one leg before the other until the mountains were left behind*****0
" @entity54 hiked six hours through mountainous terrain toward @entity2 's capital*****0
after navigating down tricky mountain slopes , she and her friends came across a village and hitched a ride on a local bus*****0
she was able to connect with her family , nearly four days after the quake , from the airport in @entity80 while waiting for the next flight to @entity46*****0
she was exhausted*****0
she had n't showered or slept since before the quake*****0

her brother , @entity125 , got news of the disaster from a friend*****0
it was n't until he heard the high casualty figures and reports about the avalanches that he started to get scared*****0
he was prepared for the worst , knowing they were traveling to a @entity135 base camp in @entity2*****0
but that was basically all he knew*****0
@entity125 combed through what little information his sister left for him before the trip , but it did n't include the name of the tour group or the hotel where they were staying*****0
he took to social media and started emailing and calling hiking groups that operated in @entity2 , but no one was getting back to him*****1
on sunday , he managed to get inside his sister 's apartment in @entity150 and find documents with information on the trekking company the pair were using*****0
it was n't until that evening , after emailing the company , that he got a short reply saying that his sister and her husband were safe*****0
but that was all the information he had , and he wanted to hear directly from his sister , so he took to @entity160 to see what other people were doing to track down loved ones*****1
several strangers who were in the same location as the couple responded to his inquiries on social media , saying they were fine*****0
" it was incredible to see people that were stranded themselves over there wanting to help me*****1

worse , he had a group of older travelers and a short supply of food and water*****0
one @entity187 in the group had an international cell phone , but its battery was quickly dying*****0

thousands of miles away , in @entity214 , @entity213 picked up that call*****0
her father explained the situation : the roads were blocked and there was no way to get back to @entity80 or enter into @entity189*****0
the only way to escape was by helicopter*****0
