( @entity3 ) on tuesday , a white police officer in @entity1 , @entity2 , was charged with murder for shooting an unarmed black man in the back*****1
officer @entity7 was arrested after raw video surfaced showing him firing numerous shots at @entity10 as @entity10 ran away from a traffic stop*****0
the video footage contradicts @entity7 's statement that he felt threatened after @entity10 allegedly took his stun gun during a scuffle*****0
the @entity16 and @entity17 reported that the @entity18 has opened an investigation into the shooting death along with the @entity21 , while the @entity2 attorney general is investigating possible civil rights violations*****0
now , after watching the footage — which should remain in your memory for a long time to come — one could say that @entity7 shot @entity10 like a dog*****0
but then again , dogs usually are not treated this badly*****0
but the man was shot like a runaway slave*****0
in this case , there was clear documented evidence of what occurred , and no room for fabrications*****0
most police fatal shootings do not result in indictments because prosecutors conclude they are justifiable*****0
the police officer can always plant a gun on the suspect he shot to death , or like @entity7 , apparently place a taser near @entity10 's body and concoct some story that his life was in danger*****1

and 67 % of teens killed while fleeing or resisting arrest were black*****0
of the whites who are killed by cops , 91 % are killed by white cops*****0
sixty - eight percent of people of color who are killed by police are also killed by white officers*****1

according to @entity123 of @entity124 , the disproportionate representation of blacks and other people of color in police shootings is due to the role of racial stereotypes by police*****1
racial stereotypes , @entity132 argues , subconsciously influence an officer 's decision on whether to use deadly force , even if the police do not consciously decide to use deadly force based on race*****1

what happened in @entity1 tells us the epidemic of police deadly force has not died*****1
and yet , the mobilization and heightened consciousness of people across the nation have kept the issue on the front burner*****0
the taking of black lives by the police remains a crisis situation in @entity192 that must be addressed , because # @entity193*****1
