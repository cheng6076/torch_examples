( @entity1 ) i do n't always talk about news events with my daughters , but there was something about the story of @entity8 reporter @entity7 and the wildly offensive way she spoke to that towing company employee that made me bring it up . one of the main things i preach to my girls , ages 7 and 9 , is the importance of respecting other people , no matter who you are and what you go on to accomplish . it 's something that my husband and i just do -- we show respect to everyone from a taxi driver to a teacher to the @entity28 . let me say right here that i have lost my cool from time to time , whether it 's been a phone call with a credit card company to complain about late fees or an experience of bad service at a restaurant . in those cases , when i feel like i 'm going to pop , i keep saying , " this is unacceptable , this is unacceptable , " and either hang up in disgust or storm off . ( not perfect ways of handling these incidents , but at no time would i ever think to insult or demean the other person in these situations . ) some of @entity47 's comments , such as how she 's " on television , " imply that she may have the dangerous thinking that she , by dint of her career , education and income , is better than people who do n't get paid what she does or have the same kind of career or educational opportunities . @entity47 showed that she either forgot those " golden rule " lessons from childhood or that she has n't really lived her life with that mantra . @entity47 has since apologized on @entity68 , saying she said " some insulting and regrettable things , " and that as frustrated as she was during an experience at a towing company in @entity75 , she should " always choose to be respectful and take the high road . " but it 's not clear that apology will satisfy anyone who watched the video of her exchange with the towing company worker . " i see this @entity7 video , and think : it 's not just about how a celebrity should n't act in public , it 's how all of us should n't act , " wrote " @entity86 " on @entity68 . said " @entity88 , " also on @entity87 , " i had no idea who @entity7 was before but ... now i know she 's the kind of woman i hope i 've taught my daughters not to be .

" and " you 're about to find out who i am . " she ultimately issued an apologetic statement , and then went on morning television to apologize some more . " we went out to dinner in @entity226 , and we had one too many glasses of wine , and we thought we were fine to drive and we absolutely were not , " she said on " @entity224 . " " it 's completely unacceptable , and we are so sorry and embarrassed . we know better , and we should n't have done that . " and , she added , " when a police officer tells you to stay in the car , you stay in the car . i learned that for sure , " she told the @entity224 host . now , did @entity47 learn that when a towing company worker or anyone else makes you incredibly angry , you never berate them for their weight , job , appearance and income ? let 's hope so . can you think of other examples where the rich and powerful responded to a stressful situation with grace instead of disrespect ? share your thoughts with @entity253 on @entity68 or @entity254 on @entity255 .

( @entity1 ) i do n't always talk about news events with my daughters , but there was something about the story of @entity8 reporter @entity7 and the wildly offensive way she spoke to that towing company employee that made me bring it up*****1
one of the main things i preach to my girls , ages 7 and 9 , is the importance of respecting other people , no matter who you are and what you go on to accomplish*****0
it 's something that my husband and i just do -- we show respect to everyone from a taxi driver to a teacher to the @entity28*****0
let me say right here that i have lost my cool from time to time , whether it 's been a phone call with a credit card company to complain about late fees or an experience of bad service at a restaurant*****1
in those cases , when i feel like i 'm going to pop , i keep saying , " this is unacceptable , this is unacceptable , " and either hang up in disgust or storm off*****0
( not perfect ways of handling these incidents , but at no time would i ever think to insult or demean the other person in these situations*****0
) some of @entity47 's comments , such as how she 's " on television , " imply that she may have the dangerous thinking that she , by dint of her career , education and income , is better than people who do n't get paid what she does or have the same kind of career or educational opportunities*****1
@entity47 showed that she either forgot those " golden rule " lessons from childhood or that she has n't really lived her life with that mantra*****0
@entity47 has since apologized on @entity68 , saying she said " some insulting and regrettable things , " and that as frustrated as she was during an experience at a towing company in @entity75 , she should " always choose to be respectful and take the high road*****1
" but it 's not clear that apology will satisfy anyone who watched the video of her exchange with the towing company worker*****1
" i see this @entity7 video , and think : it 's not just about how a celebrity should n't act in public , it 's how all of us should n't act , " wrote " @entity86 " on @entity68*****1
said " @entity88 , " also on @entity87 , " i had no idea who @entity7 was before but ... now i know she 's the kind of woman i hope i 've taught my daughters not to be*****1
" " her language and disdain brings shame on her , her profession , and her employer*****0
people do n't all of sudden have such a vile tirade*****0
this comes after years of practice and a pattern of similar behaviors*****0
let 's let her be an example to others , " wrote @entity106 on a @entity108 petition asking @entity47 's employers to fire her*****1
the @entity47 story seemed to strike a chord in our household because my older daughter asked what was going to happen to her*****1
this morning , i told her @entity47 was suspended for a week by @entity8 , and that led to another conversation*****1
my kids seemed to get it and many celebrities also seem to remember to " treat other people the way you would want them to treat you " even in uncomfortable moments*****0
celebrity apologies : the good , bad and uncomfortable so , @entity7 , check out these examples of how the rich , famous and powerful handled stressful situations with grace and dignity*****1
after @entity137 journalist @entity136 seriously fat - shamed pop music star @entity135 , saying a host of insulting things about the singer 's weight , @entity135 won praise for her graceful response*****0
" that 's because she does n't know me*****0
i 'm awesome*****0
it does n't bother me*****0
it 's a free world*****0
say what you will*****0
i 've just never cared what people think , " she said*****0
a college baseball player gets suspended for calling @entity154 baseball phenom @entity153 a " slut*****0
" her response ? she emailed @entity157 asking that the college reinstate him*****0
" everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance , " @entity153 , the first girl to earn a win and to pitch a shutout in @entity164 history , told @entity8*****0
" ... i know right now he 's really hurt and i know how hard he worked to get where he is*****0
i mean , i was pretty hurt on my part but i know he 's hurting even more*****0
" when an @entity174 journalist wrote an open letter to @entity176 expressing concern about the pontiff meeting with the country 's president ahead of the general election in october and possibly influencing the outcome , what did the @entity176 do ? well , he picked up the phone and gave the journalist a call*****0
wish we could have been a fly on the wall for that conversation ! the pope appears to have been more than graceful , because after the conversation , the journalist pledged to learn how to pray*****0
when @entity196 @entity195 faced immense criticism after allegedly lip - synching the national anthem in honor of president @entity201 's inauguration in 2013 , she did n't come out swinging*****0
instead , she admitted to singing along with her " pre-recorded track " at the inauguration but only after she opened her news conference with what was described as a stirring , a cappella rendition of the national anthem*****0
finally , @entity209 may be the closest example for @entity47 to consider when it comes to overcoming a very offensive episode*****0
when @entity209 and her husband were pulled over in 2013 for suspicion of driving under the influence , the @entity214 winning actress was recorded making comments to the officer such as , " do you know who i am ? " and " you 're about to find out who i am*****0
" she ultimately issued an apologetic statement , and then went on morning television to apologize some more*****0
" we went out to dinner in @entity226 , and we had one too many glasses of wine , and we thought we were fine to drive and we absolutely were not , " she said on " @entity224*****0
" " it 's completely unacceptable , and we are so sorry and embarrassed*****0
we know better , and we should n't have done that*****0
" and , she added , " when a police officer tells you to stay in the car , you stay in the car*****0
i learned that for sure , " she told the @entity224 host*****0
now , did @entity47 learn that when a towing company worker or anyone else makes you incredibly angry , you never berate them for their weight , job , appearance and income ? let 's hope so*****1
can you think of other examples where the rich and powerful responded to a stressful situation with grace instead of disrespect ? share your thoughts with @entity253 on @entity68 or @entity254 on @entity255 .*****1
