( @entity1 ) this week 's attack on @entity2 is @entity4 's fifth major assault in @entity5 in the past year and a half . the thursday massacre was the most deadly assault so far , with 147 dead , easily eclipsing the terrorist group 's most notorious attack , a four - day siege in late september 2013 at the @entity12 in @entity13 in which 67 people were killed . after the @entity12 attack , @entity4 unleashed a string of attacks in @entity5 that have killed more than 100 people -- assaulting the coastal town of @entity20 on june 16 , 2014 ; shooting bus passengers who could not recite the @entity22 on november 22 , 2014 ; and then , days later , executing @entity24 quarry laborers . why is @entity4 , a @entity25 nationalist , @entity26 group affiliated with @entity27 , targeting @entity5 ? @entity4 says its attacks are to protest the more than 3,500 @entity5 soldiers participating in the @entity31 peacekeeping mission in @entity25 . but if that is the case , why does n't @entity4 target @entity5 military bases rather than attacking undefended so - called soft targets such as @entity5 malls and universities ? in fact , thursday 's attack on the university is one more sign of the weakness of @entity4 , which has steadily been losing ground for years in @entity25 as a result of the @entity31 forces fighting them there , as well as a covert @entity47 drone and @entity49 campaign that has also degraded the group 's capabilities . in 2006 , @entity4 controlled the @entity25 capital of @entity53 and , in the following years , much of central and southern @entity25 . six years later , @entity31 forces had recaptured @entity53 , parts of southern @entity25 and critical cities such as @entity57 . the loss of @entity57 , @entity4 's last city stronghold and an important port , took a financial toll on the group . ground battles with @entity31 forces have decimated @entity4 's rank - and - file , while @entity47 drone strikes and special operations raids have killed some of the group 's leaders . in the past four years , according to a count by @entity70 , the @entity47 has launched a dozen drone strikes and six @entity73 raids against @entity4 . these strikes and raids -- almost all occurring in southern @entity25 -- have targeted the terrorist group 's training camps and leaders . @entity47 drones or special operators have killed 10 leaders : @entity82 , the top commander ; @entity83 , @entity82 's successor ; a top commander , sheikh @entity84 ; @entity85 , a senior official who operated training camps ; commander @entity87 ; @entity88 , the deputy of military leader @entity89 ; chief bomb - maker @entity90 ; intelligence chief @entity92 ; @entity93 , the chief of external operations and planning for intelligence and security ; and @entity99 , who was involved in planning the @entity12 attack . @entity4 has been unraveling for years . thursday 's attack should remind the world that the group is a pale shadow of the organization that once dominated much of @entity25 but now is reduced to high profile attacks against undefended civilian targets . ​

( @entity1 ) this week 's attack on @entity2 is @entity4 's fifth major assault in @entity5 in the past year and a half*****1
the thursday massacre was the most deadly assault so far , with 147 dead , easily eclipsing the terrorist group 's most notorious attack , a four - day siege in late september 2013 at the @entity12 in @entity13 in which 67 people were killed*****1
after the @entity12 attack , @entity4 unleashed a string of attacks in @entity5 that have killed more than 100 people -- assaulting the coastal town of @entity20 on june 16 , 2014 ; shooting bus passengers who could not recite the @entity22 on november 22 , 2014 ; and then , days later , executing @entity24 quarry laborers*****1
why is @entity4 , a @entity25 nationalist , @entity26 group affiliated with @entity27 , targeting @entity5 ? @entity4 says its attacks are to protest the more than 3,500 @entity5 soldiers participating in the @entity31 peacekeeping mission in @entity25*****1
but if that is the case , why does n't @entity4 target @entity5 military bases rather than attacking undefended so - called soft targets such as @entity5 malls and universities ? in fact , thursday 's attack on the university is one more sign of the weakness of @entity4 , which has steadily been losing ground for years in @entity25 as a result of the @entity31 forces fighting them there , as well as a covert @entity47 drone and @entity49 campaign that has also degraded the group 's capabilities*****1
in 2006 , @entity4 controlled the @entity25 capital of @entity53 and , in the following years , much of central and southern @entity25*****0
six years later , @entity31 forces had recaptured @entity53 , parts of southern @entity25 and critical cities such as @entity57*****1
the loss of @entity57 , @entity4 's last city stronghold and an important port , took a financial toll on the group*****1
ground battles with @entity31 forces have decimated @entity4 's rank - and - file , while @entity47 drone strikes and special operations raids have killed some of the group 's leaders*****1
in the past four years , according to a count by @entity70 , the @entity47 has launched a dozen drone strikes and six @entity73 raids against @entity4*****1
these strikes and raids -- almost all occurring in southern @entity25 -- have targeted the terrorist group 's training camps and leaders*****1
@entity47 drones or special operators have killed 10 leaders : @entity82 , the top commander ; @entity83 , @entity82 's successor ; a top commander , sheikh @entity84 ; @entity85 , a senior official who operated training camps ; commander @entity87 ; @entity88 , the deputy of military leader @entity89 ; chief bomb - maker @entity90 ; intelligence chief @entity92 ; @entity93 , the chief of external operations and planning for intelligence and security ; and @entity99 , who was involved in planning the @entity12 attack*****1
@entity4 has been unraveling for years*****0
thursday 's attack should remind the world that the group is a pale shadow of the organization that once dominated much of @entity25 but now is reduced to high profile attacks against undefended civilian targets*****1
