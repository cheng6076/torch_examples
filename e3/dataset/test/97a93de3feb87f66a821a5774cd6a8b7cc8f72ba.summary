they are still missing*****0
for this we should all feel shame : shame that we live in a world where the lives of young girls can be shattered with impunity by fanatical thugs*****1
shame that when such horrendous acts occur , our collective attention span is so fleeting*****1
a year ago , i could never have imagined that we would be here today , marking the grim 12 - month milestone of these girls going missing*****1
in the early days of their abduction much of the world stood as one , rallying around the hashtag # @entity28*****0
on the ground in @entity1 as part of @entity2 's team covering the story , i was buoyed by this global solidarity*****1
a year on , meet the man still fighting to # @entity28 caught in the blinding glare of global attention , and facing a tide of questions about their bungled response to the kidnappings , the @entity1 government felt the weight of accountability and was spurred to take greater action ; offers of assistance from the likes of the @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , and @entity52 were accepted*****1
promise after promise was made by @entity1 government officials that the girls would come home -- so where are they , and where is the global outrage over these broken promises and broken dreams ? my heart goes out to the grief - stricken loved ones of these missing girls on this painful anniversary*****1
poor and socially marginalized , all many of them have is their hope that their girls will one day return*****0
girls who escaped risk lives to go to school the task of keeping that hope alive has largely been taken up by the handful of # @entity28 campaigners in @entity1*****1
these men and women have worked tirelessly to keep the story alive for the past year ; their struggle has been a painful and increasingly lonely one*****0
but as the world 's gaze has shifted they have continued to meet the @entity1 government 's silence with cries of : " bring back our girls , now and alive ! " at this point , finding the girls will not be easy*****1
