@entity2 , @entity3 ( @entity4 ) the clamor and chaos of the previous day has dissipated by the time we arrive at @entity2 's only airport*****1
the mad rush of 24 hours previously , in those first confusing , cacophonous hours following the 7.8 - magnitude earthquake near the @entity3 capital , had died down*****0
now , families sit , camped out , silent and patiently waiting , but for now abandoned*****0
at the airport , at passport control , we meet a @entity3 man , who is unable to contact his family*****0
they live in a village 20 km from the epicenter*****0
he also has two cousins on @entity21 , he says*****0
he has no way to reach any of them*****0
follow the latest coverage of @entity3 earthquake stepping out of the terminal building , the devastation is apparent*****0
it is an overwhelming introduction to this city that , less than 48 hours ago , was hit by the worst earthquake this country has experienced in 80 years*****1
the death toll has skipped past 3,000 and climbs , inexorably*****0
taking into account the fact that many rural areas , just as badly affected but isolated and vulnerable , have yet to be evaluated , the human cost is staggering*****0
across town the bus station is a hive of activity as scores try urgently to leave the city , to make it out to the outlying areas so badly affected by this quake*****0
communications are down and so many here are desperate to make it out to their stricken families , and discover their fate*****0
the scene is repeated at every gas station ; snaking lines of @entity56 - made @entity55 cars , and motorcycles , waiting to fill up*****0
people are clambering aboard buses , into cars , trying to get as far away from this devastation as possible*****0
remaining inside @entity2 , neighbors stare forlornly at their former homes , now collapsed piles of rubble*****1
we visit a @entity67 school , mercifully empty as the children had the saturday off*****0
a seven - story building behind it , however , was home to a small church , and housed a congregation of between 40 and 50 when tragedy occurred*****1
the pastor 's son @entity75 clambers up a ladder , looking for an entrance into the ruined facade , looking to retrieve his father , not knowing if he will find him alive or dead*****0
rescue teams stop him before he reaches the top*****0
the building is not secure , but @entity75 does n't care*****0
" it 's sad , it 's hard , " he says*****0
six bodies had already been pulled from the concrete and steel wreckage*****0
a nearby five - story structure has collapsed in on itself*****0
it was pink , with wrought balconies*****0
now it is pancaked , reduced to a third of its height and a mess of rubble and reinforced steel*****0
one woman has been pulled out of the wreckage , and rescuers continue to work in a precarious hollow scooped out from the fallen bricks*****0
officials tell the onlookers that there is a chance that survivors may have been protected in a corridor as the building came down around them*****0
a day after the earthquake struck , they found a woman under the rubble*****0
unhurt ; in shock , but alive*****0
it is this hope that keeps @entity116 going : the belief that his wife and 7 - year - old are still alive*****0
" i raced here after the earthquake*****0
i have n't slept for days , " he says*****0
workers dig painstakingly , slowly removing piles of stone and debris*****1
they spot someone 's hair , but ca n't yet reach the body or tell if it 's male or female*****0
wherever there is rubble in this city , there is a police or military presence*****0
they are not necessarily commanding the digs but they keep onlookers from getting too close , or directing traffic as best they can*****0
for their part , the onlookers look shell shocked -- there is little outpouring of grief , no sobbing or wailing , but rather a solemn , dazed , collective sense of disbelief*****0
@entity152 was , just two days ago , a vast , open green oasis in the city , but is now a mess of tents*****0
some have made their own , the army is setting up others*****0
metal bleacher - style seating has been set up , with dozens of people sitting , waiting , makeshift blue tarp tents pitched underneath*****0
people bring in fresh fruit , and there are water sellers -- although clean bottled water is becoming hard to to find*****0
people queue endlessly for food and water*****0
there is a mobile government field hospital here , and those treated wait listlessly outside , a collection of crushed hands , broken legs , strapped ankles*****0
one little boy was hit by a falling brick*****0
" i felt something like a fire , and i ran , and then something hurt me a lot*****0
" he says*****0
" i am still scared*****0
" and so is everybody else : those who survived clinging to those they love*****0
