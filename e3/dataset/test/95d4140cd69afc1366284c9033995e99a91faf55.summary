" @entity172 said the focus needs to be on eradicating human trafficking and that the responsibility lies with the whole world , " not just @entity14 and @entity50 .

" " and as long as countries of origin and transit do not take action to prevent these desperate trips , people will continue to put their lives at risk , " the statement read . many of the migrants who board ships to cross the @entity4 are from @entity245 , and travel for weeks just to get to the ships . they 're seeking a better life , but many are exploited by the traffickers who organize the voyages . already this year , more than 900 migrants are believed to have died while crossing the @entity4 -- far more than during the same period in 2014 , the @entity123 said friday . in one four - day period alone , more than 8,000 migrants were rescued , according to the @entity14 @entity62 . on one day alone , sos calls came in from 20 boats in distress . @entity257 , a @entity50 member of the @entity258 , told @entity5 on sunday that countries from @entity73 need to share the responsibility with their southern neighbors .
