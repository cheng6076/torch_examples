( @entity0 ) the verdict of the opinion polls on the @entity4 election debate between seven party leaders was simple enough : between @entity14 of the @entity15 , @entity16 of @entity17 , @entity18 of the @entity19 , @entity20 of the @entity21 , @entity7 of the @entity8 , @entity9 of the @entity10 and @entity11 of @entity12 , the @entity13 , there really was no clear winner . @entity23 for @entity24 , which staged the debate , had @entity14 , @entity16 and @entity20 tied first with 21 % and @entity9 close behind on 20 % . @entity26 for @entity27 scored it @entity16 25 , @entity14 24 , @entity20 19 and @entity9 17 . @entity29 for the @entity30 put @entity9 first with 28 points to 20 for @entity20 , 18 for @entity14 and only 15 for @entity16 . back in the 1950s , @entity4 politics was simpler : @entity17 and conservatives combined took 97 % of the votes . but nowadays they struggle to collect two - thirds of the national vote between them . in our anti-politics age nationalists and others have advanced and the leaders ' tv debate was no gladiatorial contest with a straightforward outcome . rather it was a cacophonous shouting match that probably gave all parties ' supporters some satisfaction but which offered little new insight to the undecided voter . from a highly confused affair we can perhaps take six lessons : as the incumbent prime minister , @entity14 is probably wise to have refused all invitations to go head to head with @entity16 alone in verbal fisticuffs . he has risked being labelled a coward for doing so but it was a tactical decision . @entity16 has been given a hard time by the @entity4 media who have gloated over his difficulties in eating a bacon sandwich and presented him as an awkward geek . but @entity17 's leader is a perfectly capable debater . he could only gain from their confrontation . as it is , election time media exposure has already seen @entity16 's ratings as a leader improve . the electoral strengths and weaknesses of the two main leaders are emerging . in an earlier clash involving separate sessions before a studio audience and in a grilling by @entity81 's @entity80 @entity79 , @entity14 proved vulnerable on broken promises to cut immigration , on the number of people employed on zero - hours contracts and on being too kind to the rich in his taxation policies . @entity16 has looked unconvincing on how he will fund his promises to continue cutting the budget deficit and how he will curb immigration ; he also is still embarrassed when questioners remind audiences how he knifed his brother @entity94 to get the leader 's job . the impression so far is that @entity4 's voters do n't much like the conservatives despite the recovering economy but do n't quite trust @entity17 to continue the improvement . @entity16 , told by his handlers to look tough , is using the " i " word too much . @entity14 is curiously short on passion . an oddity of the @entity107 debate was that many who viewed it will have no chance of voting for two of the leaders involved , @entity9 of the @entity10 and @entity113 of @entity12 . but @entity9 's high score in the post-debate polls was significant . she was sharp and sassy . the number of seats gained by the @entity118 , currently on target to win as many as 50 of the 59 @entity121 seats in @entity122 , will be crucial . last time @entity17 won 41 of those seats : the more the @entity10 take , the weaker @entity17 's chance of a majority at @entity121 will be . @entity16 says he wo n't form a coalition with the @entity10 but it could be difficult for @entity17 to govern without some deal with their bitter opponents north of the border . if there was a " winner " in the debate it was @entity9 . back in the 2010 @entity4 election debates the clear victor was @entity18 of the @entity19 . then the two main party leaders frequently found themselves parroting " i agree with @entity18 . " by entering a coalition government with @entity14 ( in which the @entity19 ' insistence on raising the tax threshold for the lower paid has been a key element in increasing employment and economic recovery ) , @entity18 surrendered the @entity19 ' previous ability to pick up protest votes . @entity18 and his party have paid a heavy price for the compromises made in government , notably on student tuition fees . his debate performance was as good as any of the seven leaders but no poll gave him a rating of better than 10 % . perception is everything . in social media and studio focus groups there were plenty of plaudits for the @entity163 and even for @entity12 's @entity113 but @entity18 got hardly a mention . the @entity21 remains the joker in the pack . the party once dismissed by @entity14 as a collection of " fruitcakes , loonies and closet racists " is a serious threat to the @entity15 -- and @entity17 -- despite the many gaffes that seemed to cost it some momentum lately . but @entity21 , more than any of the others , is a personal vehicle for its leader and the debate was crucial for them . grinning @entity20 's blokey saloon bar manner goes down well with studio audiences and he kept the focus on immigration . his party wo n't win many seats but he has ensured they can still tip the balance in plenty of contests , sometimes taking votes off the @entity15 , sometimes off @entity17 . @entity20 has always traded on the outer edge of political civilities and by insisting in the debate that immigrants were responsible for 60 % of @entity197 cases he earned condemnation from other leaders . on social media , dominated by the young , that earned him the maximum boo count . to " win " a tv election debate you need to avoid gaffes yourself , to wrongfoot your opponent , and to offer some excitement that gives your campaign the chance to develop momentum . you need to produce vivid soundbites which will work their way into summary reports of the debates and into campaign replays . nobody has yet succeeded in doing that in this campaign . the highly paid spin doctors employed by the three major parties are simply not worth their money . the emphasis has been on sound defense : nobody has yet scored an exciting goal . as the campaign moves on , chances will have to be taken . read : @entity230 , bacon and beer : the real issues in @entity4 's election

( @entity0 ) the verdict of the opinion polls on the @entity4 election debate between seven party leaders was simple enough : between @entity14 of the @entity15 , @entity16 of @entity17 , @entity18 of the @entity19 , @entity20 of the @entity21 , @entity7 of the @entity8 , @entity9 of the @entity10 and @entity11 of @entity12 , the @entity13 , there really was no clear winner*****1
@entity23 for @entity24 , which staged the debate , had @entity14 , @entity16 and @entity20 tied first with 21 % and @entity9 close behind on 20 %*****1
@entity26 for @entity27 scored it @entity16 25 , @entity14 24 , @entity20 19 and @entity9 17*****1
@entity29 for the @entity30 put @entity9 first with 28 points to 20 for @entity20 , 18 for @entity14 and only 15 for @entity16*****1
back in the 1950s , @entity4 politics was simpler : @entity17 and conservatives combined took 97 % of the votes*****0
but nowadays they struggle to collect two - thirds of the national vote between them*****0
in our anti-politics age nationalists and others have advanced and the leaders ' tv debate was no gladiatorial contest with a straightforward outcome*****1
rather it was a cacophonous shouting match that probably gave all parties ' supporters some satisfaction but which offered little new insight to the undecided voter*****0
from a highly confused affair we can perhaps take six lessons : as the incumbent prime minister , @entity14 is probably wise to have refused all invitations to go head to head with @entity16 alone in verbal fisticuffs*****1
he has risked being labelled a coward for doing so but it was a tactical decision*****0
@entity16 has been given a hard time by the @entity4 media who have gloated over his difficulties in eating a bacon sandwich and presented him as an awkward geek*****1
but @entity17 's leader is a perfectly capable debater*****0
he could only gain from their confrontation*****0
as it is , election time media exposure has already seen @entity16 's ratings as a leader improve*****1
the electoral strengths and weaknesses of the two main leaders are emerging*****0
in an earlier clash involving separate sessions before a studio audience and in a grilling by @entity81 's @entity80 @entity79 , @entity14 proved vulnerable on broken promises to cut immigration , on the number of people employed on zero - hours contracts and on being too kind to the rich in his taxation policies*****0
@entity16 has looked unconvincing on how he will fund his promises to continue cutting the budget deficit and how he will curb immigration ; he also is still embarrassed when questioners remind audiences how he knifed his brother @entity94 to get the leader 's job*****0
the impression so far is that @entity4 's voters do n't much like the conservatives despite the recovering economy but do n't quite trust @entity17 to continue the improvement*****1
@entity16 , told by his handlers to look tough , is using the " i " word too much*****0
@entity14 is curiously short on passion*****0
an oddity of the @entity107 debate was that many who viewed it will have no chance of voting for two of the leaders involved , @entity9 of the @entity10 and @entity113 of @entity12*****1
but @entity9 's high score in the post-debate polls was significant*****0
she was sharp and sassy*****0
the number of seats gained by the @entity118 , currently on target to win as many as 50 of the 59 @entity121 seats in @entity122 , will be crucial*****0
last time @entity17 won 41 of those seats : the more the @entity10 take , the weaker @entity17 's chance of a majority at @entity121 will be*****0
@entity16 says he wo n't form a coalition with the @entity10 but it could be difficult for @entity17 to govern without some deal with their bitter opponents north of the border*****0
if there was a " winner " in the debate it was @entity9*****1
back in the 2010 @entity4 election debates the clear victor was @entity18 of the @entity19*****1
then the two main party leaders frequently found themselves parroting " i agree with @entity18*****1
" by entering a coalition government with @entity14 ( in which the @entity19 ' insistence on raising the tax threshold for the lower paid has been a key element in increasing employment and economic recovery ) , @entity18 surrendered the @entity19 ' previous ability to pick up protest votes*****0
@entity18 and his party have paid a heavy price for the compromises made in government , notably on student tuition fees*****0
his debate performance was as good as any of the seven leaders but no poll gave him a rating of better than 10 %*****1
perception is everything*****0
in social media and studio focus groups there were plenty of plaudits for the @entity163 and even for @entity12 's @entity113 but @entity18 got hardly a mention*****0
the @entity21 remains the joker in the pack*****0
the party once dismissed by @entity14 as a collection of " fruitcakes , loonies and closet racists " is a serious threat to the @entity15 -- and @entity17 -- despite the many gaffes that seemed to cost it some momentum lately*****1
but @entity21 , more than any of the others , is a personal vehicle for its leader and the debate was crucial for them*****0
grinning @entity20 's blokey saloon bar manner goes down well with studio audiences and he kept the focus on immigration*****0
his party wo n't win many seats but he has ensured they can still tip the balance in plenty of contests , sometimes taking votes off the @entity15 , sometimes off @entity17*****0
@entity20 has always traded on the outer edge of political civilities and by insisting in the debate that immigrants were responsible for 60 % of @entity197 cases he earned condemnation from other leaders*****1
on social media , dominated by the young , that earned him the maximum boo count*****0
to " win " a tv election debate you need to avoid gaffes yourself , to wrongfoot your opponent , and to offer some excitement that gives your campaign the chance to develop momentum*****1
you need to produce vivid soundbites which will work their way into summary reports of the debates and into campaign replays*****0
nobody has yet succeeded in doing that in this campaign*****0
the highly paid spin doctors employed by the three major parties are simply not worth their money*****0
the emphasis has been on sound defense : nobody has yet scored an exciting goal*****0
as the campaign moves on , chances will have to be taken*****0
