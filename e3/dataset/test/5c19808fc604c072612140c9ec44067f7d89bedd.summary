" before founding @entity36 , @entity46 had developed a similar technology called @entity186 , which he then subsequently sold . this technology was first used during the production of the 1997 sci - fi cult movie @entity189 , to scan an underground cave . " they found out it was going to cost too much money to measure the cave so they could model it , something like half a million dollars and six weeks . " they had heard about our scanning system so we went there . i think we did it for 20,000 dollars , and in a day or two , and it got used in a movie for the first time .

they proceeded to do so after an attempt at bringing down the 175 - foot tall sculptures with anti-aircraft artillery had failed*****0
sadly , the event was just the first in a series of atrocities that have robbed the world of some of its most prized cultural heritage*****0
but historical architecture is also under threat from calamities which might well escape our control , such as earthquakes and climate change*****1
the thought of losing a piece of our collective history is a bleak one*****0
but if loss ca n't be avoided , technology can lend a hand*****0
now @entity36 , a non-profit company founded by an @entity39 - born engineer , is using groundbreaking laser scanning to ensure that -- at the very least -- incredibly accurate digital versions of the world 's treasures will stay with us forever*****1
