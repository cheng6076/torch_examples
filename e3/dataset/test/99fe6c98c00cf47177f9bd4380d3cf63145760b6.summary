( @entity4 ) if newly revised @entity2 training materials are approved by a federal judge , new cadets could be taking courses reminding them " not to engage in racial profiling . " the proposed training materials , overseen by appointed federal monitor @entity8 , were submitted to @entity11 judge @entity10 on monday for approval . they include directives to " not tell or tolerate ethnic , racial or sexist jokes " and to " not imitate the speech patterns " of others . " do not engage in racial profiling , " the training materials read . " it is against the law . it violates fundamental democratic precepts and freedoms . it violates this department 's policies . it is offensive . it violates your responsibility to treat people equally . it diverts us from catching real criminals . it alienates us from people who need us , and hurts our ability to do our job . you can probably think of other reasons not to do it , but the point is that you will not do it . " the training notes also instruct new cadets " not to use terms or words that devalue groups of people or stereotype them " and " not to imitate speech patterns of other racial , ethnic and class groups when communicating cross culturally " because " they appear disingenuous , artificial , and possibly racist . " the revised training notes , which include 140 pages of instruction and powerpoint slides , are a result of a 2013 federal ruling declaring the @entity2 's " @entity61 " practice unconstitutional . the @entity2 has said the policy -- in which police stop , question and frisk people they consider suspicious -- was used to deter crime . the practice had been widely criticized . @entity70 figures showed that nearly nine out of 10 people " stopped and frisked " in 2011 were @entity72 or @entity73 , though @entity75 mayor @entity74 has said 90 % of those stopped were innocent . " the current training materials had not undergone a comprehensive review for some time ... [ and ] did not address some important subjects or account for some changes in @entity2 policies and law , " @entity8 wrote in a cover letter to @entity10 . " all parties agreed it was essential that the materials be rewritten for the current class to reflect current law and policy . " the @entity2 collaborated with @entity8 's team in crafting the final training materials . they will now " review their implementation in terms of our current and ongoing practices , " said an @entity2 spokesperson in an email to @entity4 . the @entity99 declined to comment . the materials also provide historical legal information on proper " stops " and offers detailed procedures for patrolling buildings for criminal activity . they also give instructions on how an officer should lawfully conduct him or herself when engaging with the public . " remember that a courteous , professional and respectful police officer who illustrates the opposite of bias and discrimination helps create a partnership with the community and builds rapport with the people in it . " the result is that the citizens become our allies and , in turn , policing becomes safer and easier . this enhances our effectiveness and increases our pride and pleasure in what we do , " the notes read . if approved , the new training materials will be integrated into the class curriculum for the current class of cadets . they are expected to graduate in june .
