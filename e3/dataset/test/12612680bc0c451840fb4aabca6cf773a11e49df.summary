" over the years , " @entity2 " has become one of the most dissected and argued - about songs in the pop music canon . @entity5 has said that the opening lines were inspired by the death of @entity34 , but after that , it 's all been conjecture -- which has n't stopped a marching band 's worth of analysts from trying to parse the symbols in the 8 - minute , 33 - second opus . is the jester @entity43 ? the football game @entity45 ? the " girl who sang the blues " @entity48 ? ( one thing 's certain : @entity34 's plane was not named " @entity2 . " ) " over the years i 've dealt with all these stupid questions of ' who 's that ? ' and ' who 's that ? ' " @entity5 said . " these are things i never had in my head for a second when i wrote the song . i was trying to capture something very ephemeral and i did , but it took a long time . " the song catapulted the former folk singer to headliner status . the song hit no. 1 in early 1972 , despite its length . ( the 45 - rpm single split the song in half on its a and b sides . ) the draft that was auctioned is 16 pages : 237 lines of manuscript and 26 lines of typed text , according to @entity7 . it includes lines that did n't make the final version as well as extensive notes -- all of which should be revealing , @entity5 said . the record for a popular music manuscript is held by @entity43 's " like a @entity17 , " which sold for $ 2 million in june . opinion : what 's so great about ' @entity2 ' ?
