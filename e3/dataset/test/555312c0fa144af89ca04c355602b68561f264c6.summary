( @entity0 ) have you ever found the creative inspiration you were seeking at the most unexpected time , or thought you were having that long - awaited problem - solving epiphany just as you nodded off to sleep ? according to neuroscientists @entity7 and @entity8 , there 's a reason for that*****0
their book , " @entity13 " , explores the influences at work behind that much sought - after " @entity17 ! " moment*****0
research suggests that in trying to conjure up inspiration , most of us end up suppressing it*****0
the book explains how to clear out mental junk , in order to make way for pivotal revelations*****0
dr. @entity7 explained : " insights involve unusual connections*****0
cognitive psychologists call these ' remote associations '*****0
they are processed mostly in the brain 's right hemisphere*****0
insights occur when a subconscious remote association suddenly pops into awareness*****0
this is accompanied by a burst of activity in the brain 's right temporal lobe*****0
" " we wrote " @entity13 " to help people understand how creative insight works in the brain so they can use various strategies harmoniously without having them cross-circuit each other , " said @entity7*****0
" for example , there is evidence that imagining the future helps to put someone in an insightful state*****0

" " that said , a positive mood and a broad , expansive spread of attention are a couple of key features of the insightful state , " he added*****0
following are some of the tips they suggest for unleashing your creative potential -- both at home and at work*****0
@entity73 helps broaden thoughts*****0
even high ceilings have been shown to broaden attention*****0
small , windowless offices , low ceilings and narrow corridors will do little to inspire our brains and make us flexible , creative thinkers*****0
relaxing outdoor colors such as blue and green contribute to this state*****0
" emergency " colors such as red suppress it*****0
surprisingly , dark colors and dim lighting can also be beneficial : by obscuring visual details , they help people think more abstractly*****0
static surroundings encourage static thinking*****0
do n't be predictable*****0
you should sometimes change everyday routines , such as where you go for coffee or your route to work*****0
rearrange your furniture and decor from time to time , at home and in your workplace*****0
hold meetings in a variety of places*****0
make sure to include some nonconformists in your inner circle*****0
unusual people tend to be out - of - the - box thinkers , and their unique outlook might help you attack a problem from a different angle*****0
the threat of a firm deadline will narrow your thinking and inhibit your insight*****0
try and use soft target dates and a flexible schedule to establish a helpful , nonthreatening time frame*****0
rewards and punishments for meeting or missing deadlines , if needed at all , should be vague and mild so they do n't contribute added pressure*****0
a positive outlook will help stimulate a more open mind , one that can process a greater number of ideas*****0
if you struggle to think happy , try focusing on the people and things that bring you joy*****0
to put a twist on @entity135 's famous saying , chance favors the happy mind*****0
when you 're stuck on a problem , take a break to do or think about something very different*****0
expose yourself to a variety of people and places*****0
listen to music or go to a pleasing movie , art exhibit or talk a walk*****0
play a game , dance , do yoga , read*****0
insight triggers appear at the most unlikely times and places*****0
we all know how important sleep is to our cognitive thinking*****0
the sleep - deprived mind is more likely to fixate on small matters -- an absolute killer to creativity*****0
ample sleep also helps foster the discovery of hidden connections between ideas*****0
@entity166 thought is at its best when your powers of inhibition are weaker , because reduced focus opens up your awareness to remote associations that would n't come to you when you 're feeling sharp*****0
if you 're an early bird , you should try doing your creative work at night*****0
if you 're a night owl , try the morning*****0
perhaps the single most important thing to remember is that your mental state can change*****0
it takes a while to sink into an insightful mindset*****0
try and schedule uninterrupted blocks of time for relaxed , freewheeling creative thought*****0
turn off your phone*****0
get rid of the clock*****0
let abstract ideas and vague impressions flow where they will*****0
