( @entity1 ) the sun had n't risen at @entity2*****0
most students slept in their beds*****0
a few had woken up to head to early morning @entity7 prayers*****0
then the terror began*****0
it started with an explosion and gunshots around 5:30 a.m. thursday ( 10:30 p.m. et wednesday ) at the @entity14 school 's front gates*****1
the attackers continued to fire as they stalked through campus , with the @entity17 saying they stopped at a girls ' dormitory*****0
at one point , they burst into a room where @entity21 had gathered and took hostages , said lecturer @entity23*****0
a student in the room told @entity26 , a reporter with @entity1 affiliate @entity27 , that the terrorists sprayed bullets indiscriminately , striking his thigh*****0
" then they proceeded to the hostels , " @entity23 told @entity1 , referring to the university dorm , " shooting anybody they came across -- except their fellows , the @entity35*****0
" according to @entity38 , the gunmen separated the students by religion and allowed @entity35 to leave*****1
this would be consistent with the past practices of @entity43 , the @entity44 - based terror group that 's claimed responsibility for the attack*****0
that 's what @entity43 did in a december raid on a quarry in the @entity14 village of @entity52 , near the @entity44 border , that ended with at least 36 killed*****0
whatever their religion , hundreds of students managed to escape , said @entity56 , a reporter with @entity1 affiliate @entity57*****0
some ran*****0
some crawled*****0
all feared for their lives*****0
and they were the lucky ones*****0
it was n't until about 15 hours after the attack began that the explosions and gunfire around @entity66 finally ended*****1
interior ministry secretary @entity67 announced that four terrorists were killed and the operation had ended " successfully*****0
" by then , 147 people were dead and plans were " underway to evacuate students and other affected persons , " the @entity70 tweeted*****1
" it is a very sad day for @entity14 , " @entity67 said*****0
some of those students , at one point or another , were believed to be hostages in one of the four dormitories on campus*****0
yet others like @entity23 managed to find safety , in his case at the staff residence*****0
others escaped the college 's grounds*****0
@entity56 , for instance , told @entity1 that he saw about 200 people sitting in the scorching mid- 90 - degree heat thursday in a corner of a @entity66 airstrip , surrounded by military officials*****0

" we saw some bloodstains , " @entity105 told @entity38 , " and they were shot*****0
" such terrorism , sadly , is n't new to the people of eastern @entity14*****0
and that 's largely thanks to @entity43*****0
while it is based in @entity44 , the militant group has made bloody incursions into neighboring @entity14 -- most notoriously a 2013 siege of @entity121 's upscale @entity120 that left at least 67 dead*****1
a primary aim of such attacks is thought to be sowing terror*****0
there 's also a religious undercurrent , given @entity43 's once and possibly future goal of creating a fundamentalist @entity129 state , according to the @entity130*****0
needless to say , that aim is n't shared in most places -- particularly in @entity14 , where more than 80 % of citizens are @entity7*****0
such violence is more likely in towns like @entity66 , given its location 90 miles west of the @entity44 border*****0
what makes thursday 's attack different is what was targeted -- an institute of higher learning , presumably filled with innocent students with no direct part in the @entity14 and allied governments ' fight against @entity43*****1
such an attack is more reminiscent of what other @entity153 extremist groups , the @entity149 @entity148 and @entity150 , did in respectively attacking a school in @entity156 , @entity149 , and kidnapping more than 200 girls at a school in @entity159 , @entity160*****1
@entity2 began in the 1990s as @entity161 before evolving , by government decree , into its current form as a degree - granting institution in 2011*****0
as of this spring , the school had schools of education , information science , and arts and social sciences*****0
and it was growing , with its staff of 75 set to expand to 200 by year 's end , according to the college 's website*****0
it 's too early to tell what the future now holds for @entity2*****0
but @entity14 president @entity180 on thursday urged people around the @entity183 nation " to stay calm as we resolve this matter*****0
" " this is a moment , " @entity180 said , " for everyone throughout the country to be vigilant as we continue to confront and defeat our enemies*****0
