( @entity0 ) slamming world powers ' framework nuclear deal with @entity3 , @entity5 prime minister @entity4 on friday demanded that any final deal include a " clear and unambiguous @entity3 recognition of @entity5 's right to exist . " @entity4 has been perhaps the most vocal critic of nuclear talks with @entity3 , insisting again and again it ca n't be trusted . he took his case to the @entity12 last month , at a time before negotiators had hammered out any sort of agreement , over the objections of president @entity17 . there 's never been any dispute about his take , but the prime minister has sharpened his rhetoric in recent days , saying the deal increases the risk of a " horrific war . " @entity3 president : we will stick to our promises on nuclear deal @entity4 has lobbied hard for a deal that dismantles and disassembles @entity3 's nuclear infrastructure -- rather than limiting its usage or repurposing @entity3 's facilities -- but such stipulations were not part of the framework agreement . he has also called for the removal of sanctions to be tied to the reduction of what he characterizes as @entity3 's aggression in the region , not just its moves on its nuclear program in the absence of both elements , @entity4 is calling the emerging deal a historic mistake . after an emergency cabinet meeting friday afternoon hours before the @entity52 holiday of @entity53 , @entity4 said the agreement " would pose a grave danger to the region and to the world and would threaten the very survival of the state of @entity5 . " " ... i want to make clear to all : the survival of @entity5 is non-negotiable , " @entity4 said . " @entity5 will not accept an agreement which allows a country that vows to annihilate us to develop nuclear weapons , period . " @entity17 called @entity4 after thursday 's announcement of the framework agreement to reassure him that @entity5 's security will remain a prime concern in the ensuing negotiations and the final deal , which faces a june 30 deadline . " there is no daylight when it comes to our support for @entity5 's security , " @entity17 said , reaffirming the @entity75 commitment to @entity5 's security . but @entity4 said he is n't convinced @entity5 is safe from @entity3 . " just two days ago , @entity3 said that ' the destruction of @entity5 is non-negotiable . ' and in these fateful days @entity3 is accelerating the arming of its terror proxies to attack @entity5 . " the @entity5 leader added that " this deal would legitimize @entity3 's nuclear program , bolster @entity3 's economy and increase @entity3 's aggression and terror throughout the @entity90 and beyond .
