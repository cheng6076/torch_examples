( @entity1 ) do you remember the talk about plans for @entity5 - led force to try to take back @entity6 this spring ? well , you might want to forget it*****1
nearly three months after a @entity9 official said up to 25,000 @entity5 troops were expected to return to the key northern @entity5 city in april or may , a senior official in president @entity14 's administration said thursday that @entity15 is " not putting a timeframe on " a possible invasion*****1
it " might be some time from now*****0
might be soon , " another senior administration official said*****0
@entity6 has long been the big prize in the @entity5 government 's fight -- aided by a @entity9 - led military coalition , which has carried out airstrikes for months -- to defeat @entity25*****1
it has also long been a source of embarrassment , considering how it fell after @entity5 troops dropped their weapons , abandoned their posts and ran for their lives when militants arrived last june*****1
the senior administration officials who talked to reporters thursday stressed the @entity5 and their allies are making progress in their fight against the group that calls itself the @entity40*****0
in fact , officials insist that @entity25 has been degraded substantially thanks to a combination of air power and ground combat*****0
the biggest and most recent example of this came with the recapture a few weeks ago of @entity48 , the hometown of former @entity5 dictator @entity49 that is located some 100 miles ( 160 kilometers ) north of @entity50*****0
@entity5 forces aided by @entity54 - backed @entity53 militiamen took that northern city , the same place where @entity25 allegedly massacred @entity5 troops last year*****1
still , @entity6 is n't @entity48*****0
for one thing , it has a lot more people -- about a million , one @entity14 administration official noted*****0
and it 's more important not only to @entity5 , but @entity25 , meaning the terrorist group has all the more reason to go all - out to defend it*****1
in some ways , the campaign for @entity6 has begun , according to officials*****0
there are no plans for @entity9 combat troops involvement in an eventual operation , they say , but airstrikes have already targeted @entity25 positions in the area*****1
just because the area has been softened up some from the air , though , does n't mean a full ground assault is imminent*****0
calling for " patience , " an administration official said that winning @entity6 is a complex endeavor*****1
it will " take a lot of capacity , " the official said , " and some time to build*****0
