@entity0 ( @entity1 ) the flight voice recorder aboard @entity3 reportedly captured blaring cockpit alarms , warning co-pilot @entity5 to " pull up " and that " terrain " was ahead*****1
but that was not enough to stop the aircraft from slamming into the @entity9*****0
with reports that @entity5 apparently ignored those warnings , there are new calls from aviation experts to develop and deploy enhanced crash avoidance software that could take control of an aircraft away from a pilot and steer the plane to a safe altitude*****1
the technology would work in a fashion similar to crash avoidance technology already used in automobiles*****0
if a pilot is incapacitated or ignores audible warnings , the plane 's flight guidance software could take over and plot a course to a safe altitude ‎*****1
in cars , these avoidance systems sometimes deploy brakes or slow a car down to a safer speed , and help maintain safe distances from other vehicles*****0
the idea is not new*****0
in fact , more than 10 years ago , following 9/11 , @entity39 , the manufacturer of the doomed aircraft , was working to d ‎ evelop aircraft crash avoidance software with tech giant @entity43 -- in part to prevent jetliners from being flown into large buildings or mountains*****0
but the project was ultimately scrapped*****0
a spokesperson for @entity43 says the company has no plans to revive the project unless federal regulators demand it be put into cockpits or airlines ask for it*****0
so far that has not happened*****0
@entity1 also asked @entity39 about the project , but the company had no comment*****0
former @entity61 inspector general @entity60 says pilots , regulators and the traveling public have , so far , not bought into claims that computers can do it better*****0
