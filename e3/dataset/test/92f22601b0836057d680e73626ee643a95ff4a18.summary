( @entity1 ) it 's no surprise which image is making the headlines from this week 's gathering of leaders from nearly three dozen nations in @entity7 : a historic handshake between president @entity9 and @entity11 president @entity10 . but this first meeting of @entity9 and @entity10 since they announced plans to start normalizing diplomatic ties should not be the end of the summit story . or at least @entity9 is hoping it wo n't be . after all , the president has had some unhappy experiences at hemispheric summits , where the headlines have often focused on some less than flattering moments . the reality is that the @entity25 has been losing ground in this increasingly important region , and @entity9 needs to put on a strong performance in @entity7 at the @entity29 if the @entity25 is to have a chance of improving ties with neighbors who should be best friends , but who have drifted away as @entity34 has been focused on challenges at home and instability in the @entity38 . unfortunately , @entity34 has lost influence in @entity34 to a hyperactive @entity44 , a cunning @entity41 and a troubling @entity42 , all of which have made inroads in the region at @entity48 's expense . this gathering therefore offers a chance for the @entity25 to reverse the tide and build on the potential offered by a natural alliance strengthened by millions of people with @entity34 and @entity56 blood who make their homes in the @entity25 . the foundations for a strong hemispheric bloc are there . but they need attention , and the @entity7 meeting offers a good opportunity to start building . but first : do no harm . large diplomatic gatherings are minutely orchestrated events , and the @entity25 , with its vast experience in preparing for high - level multilateral meetings , knows the importance of dotting the @entity72 's and crossing the @entity73 's . but this has n't stopped recent summits descending into diplomatic and @entity77 disasters for the @entity25 just look at the last summit , held in @entity79 , @entity80 , which stayed in the news much longer than anyone expected after @entity84 agents embarrassed the @entity25 by hiring prostitutes and bringing them to their hotel rooms , in violation of basic security protocols . they were reportedly caught after one of the women accused an agent of refusing to pay an agreed fee . as a result of all this , the @entity94 looked dumb , incompetent -- and cheap . and back in 2009 , the president -- new on the job -- was caught flat footed by a fast - talking , fiery @entity100 president of @entity101 . the late @entity102 outplayed the leader of the free world , who had just taken office and was trying to show @entity34 's new " outstretched hand " toward the foe of the @entity109 era . the summit hit a depressing low for the @entity9 administration when @entity102 walked up to @entity9 and , as the cameras clicked , handed the @entity34 president a copy of the book " @entity120 , " which blames the region 's woes on the @entity25 and @entity119 . yet the problems in @entity79 were n't just symbolic . regional leaders lined up against @entity48 , which had refused to include @entity11 in the summit , and vowed they would not hold any more of the gatherings unless @entity125 was also invited . @entity34 was cornered . all this stands in contrast to the optimism of the early @entity129 years , when the president issued an invitation to " democratically elected " heads of state of @entity34 , which was then breaking the chains of military dictatorship . back then , the @entity25 had just led the creation of the @entity136 ( @entity136 ) and actually seemed to stand for something attractive to the region , namely democracy , free trade and economic growth . that 's what it should aim for every time : articulating a clear vision and rallying neighbors behind it . can @entity9 manage something similar this time ? true , the president has come armed with his new @entity11 policy . unfortunately , in an effort to placate critics who say @entity9 is not doing more for pro-democracy activists , the @entity151 has miscalculated with @entity101 , handing the repressive regime of @entity102 's successor , @entity156 , a stick with which to beat the @entity25 @entity9 has long and rightly ignored @entity156 's claims that the @entity25 planned to overthrow him . but a modest plan to impose sanctions has suddenly handed @entity156 -- who has presided over an economic catastrophe in his country -- a way to portray himself a victim of the @entity25 , something he will no doubt play that up in @entity7 . all this risks again reviving memories of past tensions with @entity94 who already have complicated feelings toward the @entity25 over its @entity175 support for unseemly right - wing dictators , a policy it claimed to pursue in the name of preventing @entity180 - backed communism from taking hold . but those days are behind us . today , the people want prosperity , they want democracy , and they want the rule of law -- all of which leave a potential opening for the @entity25 . too many national leaders are eroding democratic norms : opposition leaders are in prison in @entity101 ; a prosecutor who criticized the president was found dead in @entity196 ; press freedom is under siege in several countries ; and corruption is reaching new highs . all of this suggests that if @entity9 plays his cards right , he will have the opportunity to explain to the people of @entity34 that their goals are also @entity34 's goals ; that like them , he supports democracy , human rights , the rule of law , full freedom of expression and free elections in every country . the fact that he met with @entity11 dissidents was welcome , and sends a message that he is not neglecting other issues such as human rights as he recasts relations with @entity11 . for the millions in @entity34 that still live in poverty , these freedoms can seem like a distant luxury . but if @entity9 can show them that the @entity25 is a true partner in efforts to improve their lives , then he will leave a longer - lasting legacy in the region than just a handshake .

( @entity1 ) it 's no surprise which image is making the headlines from this week 's gathering of leaders from nearly three dozen nations in @entity7 : a historic handshake between president @entity9 and @entity11 president @entity10*****0
but this first meeting of @entity9 and @entity10 since they announced plans to start normalizing diplomatic ties should not be the end of the summit story*****1
or at least @entity9 is hoping it wo n't be*****0
after all , the president has had some unhappy experiences at hemispheric summits , where the headlines have often focused on some less than flattering moments*****0
the reality is that the @entity25 has been losing ground in this increasingly important region , and @entity9 needs to put on a strong performance in @entity7 at the @entity29 if the @entity25 is to have a chance of improving ties with neighbors who should be best friends , but who have drifted away as @entity34 has been focused on challenges at home and instability in the @entity38*****1
unfortunately , @entity34 has lost influence in @entity34 to a hyperactive @entity44 , a cunning @entity41 and a troubling @entity42 , all of which have made inroads in the region at @entity48 's expense*****0
this gathering therefore offers a chance for the @entity25 to reverse the tide and build on the potential offered by a natural alliance strengthened by millions of people with @entity34 and @entity56 blood who make their homes in the @entity25*****0
the foundations for a strong hemispheric bloc are there*****0
but they need attention , and the @entity7 meeting offers a good opportunity to start building*****0
but first : do no harm*****0
large diplomatic gatherings are minutely orchestrated events , and the @entity25 , with its vast experience in preparing for high - level multilateral meetings , knows the importance of dotting the @entity72 's and crossing the @entity73 's*****0
but this has n't stopped recent summits descending into diplomatic and @entity77 disasters for the @entity25 just look at the last summit , held in @entity79 , @entity80 , which stayed in the news much longer than anyone expected after @entity84 agents embarrassed the @entity25 by hiring prostitutes and bringing them to their hotel rooms , in violation of basic security protocols*****0
they were reportedly caught after one of the women accused an agent of refusing to pay an agreed fee*****0
as a result of all this , the @entity94 looked dumb , incompetent -- and cheap*****0
and back in 2009 , the president -- new on the job -- was caught flat footed by a fast - talking , fiery @entity100 president of @entity101*****0
the late @entity102 outplayed the leader of the free world , who had just taken office and was trying to show @entity34 's new " outstretched hand " toward the foe of the @entity109 era*****0
the summit hit a depressing low for the @entity9 administration when @entity102 walked up to @entity9 and , as the cameras clicked , handed the @entity34 president a copy of the book " @entity120 , " which blames the region 's woes on the @entity25 and @entity119*****1
yet the problems in @entity79 were n't just symbolic*****0
regional leaders lined up against @entity48 , which had refused to include @entity11 in the summit , and vowed they would not hold any more of the gatherings unless @entity125 was also invited*****0
@entity34 was cornered*****0
all this stands in contrast to the optimism of the early @entity129 years , when the president issued an invitation to " democratically elected " heads of state of @entity34 , which was then breaking the chains of military dictatorship*****0
back then , the @entity25 had just led the creation of the @entity136 ( @entity136 ) and actually seemed to stand for something attractive to the region , namely democracy , free trade and economic growth*****0
that 's what it should aim for every time : articulating a clear vision and rallying neighbors behind it*****0
can @entity9 manage something similar this time ? true , the president has come armed with his new @entity11 policy*****0
unfortunately , in an effort to placate critics who say @entity9 is not doing more for pro-democracy activists , the @entity151 has miscalculated with @entity101 , handing the repressive regime of @entity102 's successor , @entity156 , a stick with which to beat the @entity25 @entity9 has long and rightly ignored @entity156 's claims that the @entity25 planned to overthrow him*****0
but a modest plan to impose sanctions has suddenly handed @entity156 -- who has presided over an economic catastrophe in his country -- a way to portray himself a victim of the @entity25 , something he will no doubt play that up in @entity7*****0
all this risks again reviving memories of past tensions with @entity94 who already have complicated feelings toward the @entity25 over its @entity175 support for unseemly right - wing dictators , a policy it claimed to pursue in the name of preventing @entity180 - backed communism from taking hold*****0
but those days are behind us*****0
today , the people want prosperity , they want democracy , and they want the rule of law -- all of which leave a potential opening for the @entity25*****0
too many national leaders are eroding democratic norms : opposition leaders are in prison in @entity101 ; a prosecutor who criticized the president was found dead in @entity196 ; press freedom is under siege in several countries ; and corruption is reaching new highs*****0
all of this suggests that if @entity9 plays his cards right , he will have the opportunity to explain to the people of @entity34 that their goals are also @entity34 's goals ; that like them , he supports democracy , human rights , the rule of law , full freedom of expression and free elections in every country*****0
the fact that he met with @entity11 dissidents was welcome , and sends a message that he is not neglecting other issues such as human rights as he recasts relations with @entity11*****0
for the millions in @entity34 that still live in poverty , these freedoms can seem like a distant luxury*****0
but if @entity9 can show them that the @entity25 is a true partner in efforts to improve their lives , then he will leave a longer - lasting legacy in the region than just a handshake .*****1
