@entity2 is located on a major plate boundary between @entity106 and @entity107 , where collisions have been in progress for about 50 million years*****1
those collisions are responsible for the construction of the @entity81 , which has the tallest and some of the fastest growing mountains in the world , said @entity114 , director of @entity116 's @entity115 and @entity117*****0
@entity106 is moving northward into @entity107 at a rate of about 45 millimeters a year , with earthquakes of a magnitude from 8 to 9 occurring on average in the @entity81 every 500 to 1,000 years , said @entity122 , associate professor of geological sciences with the @entity125 's @entity124*****0
the last major earthquake to affect this part of the @entity81 was in the 1500s , and @entity20 was badly damaged in an earthquake that occurred farther east of saturday 's quake in 1934*****1
a major concern for this earthquake is damage from landslides generated by the strong shaking , @entity122 said*****1
the entire area that experienced shaking was in steep , mountainous topography where landsliding is a significant hazard*****0
@entity122 compared the circumstances to the 2008 earthquake in @entity143 , @entity144*****0
the magnitude - 7.9 earthquake generated more 200,000 landslides , many of which blocked roads , slowing response and recovery efforts*****0
the landslides also blocked river valleys , which created significant flood hazard*****0
