@entity3 ( @entity2 ) @entity1 heavyweight boxing champion @entity0 has an important title defense coming up , but his thoughts continue to be dominated by the ongoing fight for democracy in @entity8 . speaking to @entity2 from his @entity3 training base ahead of the april 25 showdown with @entity12 challenger @entity11 in @entity13 , @entity0 said the crisis in his homeland has left him shocked and upset . " my country is unfortunately suffering in the war with @entity18 -- not that @entity8 tried to give any aggression to any other nation , in this particular case @entity18 , unfortunately it 's the other way around , " @entity0 told @entity2 . " i never thought that our brother folk is going to have war with us , so that @entity8 and @entity18 are going to be divided with blood , " he added . " unfortunately , we do n't know how far it 's going to go and how worse it 's going to get . the aggression , in the military presence of ( @entity18 ) soldiers and military equipment in my country , @entity8 , is upsetting . " @entity0 is the reigning @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 champion and has , alongside older brother @entity37 , dominated the heavyweight division in the 21st century . @entity37 , who retired from boxing in 2013 , is a prominent figure in @entity8 politics . the 43 - year - old has led the @entity43 since 2010 and was elected mayor of @entity45 in may last year . tensions in the former @entity48 state remain high despite a ceasefire agreed in february as @entity50 , led by @entity52 chancellor @entity51 and president of france @entity53 , tries to broker a peace deal between the two sides . the crisis in @entity8 began in november 2013 when former president @entity58 scuttled a trade deal with the @entity60 in favor of forging closer economic ties with @entity18 . the move triggered a wave of anti-government protests which came to a head @entity45 's @entity67 in february 2014 when clashes between protesters and government security forces left around 100 dead . the following month , @entity18 troops entered @entity8 's @entity74 peninsula before @entity18 president @entity75 completed the annexation of @entity74 -- a move denounced by most of the world as illegitimate -- after citizens of the region had voted in favor of leaving @entity8 in a referendum . more than 5,000 people have been killed in the conflict to date . " people are dying in @entity8 every single day , " @entity0 said . " i do not want to see it , nobody wants to see it ... it 's hard to believe these days something like that in @entity50 -- and @entity8 is @entity50 -- can happen . " but with the backing of the international community , @entity0 is confident @entity8 can forge a democratic future rather than slide back towards a @entity48 - era style dictatorship . " i really wish and want this conflict to be solved and it can only be solved with @entity98 help , " he said . " @entity8 is looking forward to becoming a democratic country and live under @entity98 democracy . this is our decision and this is our will to get what we want . " if somebody wants to try to put ( us ) back to the @entity48 times and be part of the @entity108 , we disagree with that . we want to be in freedom . " we have achieved many things in moving forward and showed to the world that we do not want to live under a dictatorship . " @entity0 , whose comments were made as part of a wide - ranging interview for @entity2 's @entity118 series , is routinely kept abreast of developments in @entity8 by brother @entity37 but also returns home whenever he can . " as much time as i can spend , i am there in the @entity8 . it 's not like i am getting the news from mass media and making my own adjustments and judgments on what 's going on . it 's an actual presence and understanding from the inside ... it obviously affects my life , it affects the life of my family . " the 39 - year - old and his fiancée @entity137 celebrated happier times last december when the @entity12 actress gave birth to a baby daughter , @entity142 . " i need to get used to it that i 'm a father , which is really exciting . i hope i 'm going to have a big family with multiple kids , " he said . @entity0 is n't sure when he 'll finally hang up his gloves . " i do n't know how long i can last ... motivation and health have to be there to continue . " but after leaving almost all his boxing opponents battered and bruised -- the @entity8 is seeking an impressive 18th consecutive title defense against @entity11 -- @entity0 is keen to carry on fighting his own and his country 's corner in the opposite way outside the ring . " i just really want that we 'll have less violence in the world ... i hope in peace we can do anything , but if we have war then it 's definitely going to leave us dull and numb .
