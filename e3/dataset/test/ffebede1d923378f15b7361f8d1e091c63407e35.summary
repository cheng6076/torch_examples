@entity2 , @entity3 ( @entity1 ) @entity0 has come to @entity2 . after months of turmoil and upheaval , months of frustration and anger , the beleaguered city has a new governing board . and it looks very different than the old one . buoyed by a higher - than - normal 30 % turnout , two @entity12 candidates won their wards tuesday night to make the six - member @entity16 50 % black . @entity2 's population of about 21,000 is 70 % black , but the @entity16 was predominantly white , as is the police force . supporters of both candidates said that from the tragedy of a young black man 's death , a new day dawned in @entity2 . @entity25 screamed when her victory became official late tuesday night . she won 49.76 % of the vote . " thank you , @entity29 1 . i love you , " an emotional @entity30 said at a party held at @entity33 's restaurant . she will become the first black woman ever to sit on the @entity2 council . but both @entity30 and @entity37 , who won the @entity29 seat with nearly 67 % of the vote , said they did not see their victories from a racial perspective . @entity30 , who resigned her job as a @entity45 cosmetics sales director to run for office , said in her ward , she heard the same complaints from a 65 - year - old black man as she did from his white peers . " my job is to be that catalyst so we can put a new face on @entity2 , " she said . @entity37 , a lawyer and criminal justice professor , said , " i 'm more interested in having quality on the council , " when asked about the change in its racial makeup . he had made community policing his no. 1 priority and said he intends to be deeply involved with the hiring of a new police chief in this @entity65 suburb . the former chief , @entity66 , resigned after a scathing @entity69 @entity68 report found systemic discrimination against african - americans in law enforcement and the municipal court . @entity37 said he wants @entity2 's police officers to be judged by the number of people they know in the community , not by the number of tickets they issue . one other seat was up for grabs in @entity2 . that was won by @entity84 , a former mayor who launched the " @entity91 " campaign to raise money for mom - and - pop businesses that were hurt by the violence and vandalism during the protests last fall . @entity84 beat his opponent , @entity92 , with 56.7 % of the vote . @entity84 told voters he was best suited for a @entity16 job despite his critics ' claims that he was too entrenched in the old guard . " i understand that feeling , but those individuals do n't know me , " he said . @entity84 said he had contacts with elected officials from his almost three decades in politics . that would be an invaluable asset in getting @entity2 back on its feet , he said . the city is required to approve a new budget by the end of june , and the new council will have to look for alternative sources of revenue to replace the $ 3 million or so lost from money generated by traffic tickets and fines . " that amount will drop significantly , " @entity84 said . earlier in the day , the skies grew dark and the radio crackled with warnings of flash floods . amid the rain , @entity2 opened its polls at 6 in the morning with concern that few would come out to vote in such a pivotal election . but tuesday was different . it was the first city election since white police officer @entity128 shot and killed unarmed black teenager @entity129 in august . there was dread , especially in the @entity12 - @entity69 community , that if the turnout was low , then all the protests , investigations and calls for change would have been in vain . the candidates who had run campaigns calling for change hoped a decent turnout would weigh in their favor . " that is what our democracy about , " @entity37 said . @entity37 ran against @entity147 , a retired electrical plant employee , in @entity148 , which includes @entity150 , where @entity129 was killed , and the @entity152 business corridor that felt the brunt of the protests and the vandalism . charred , heavily damaged buildings still stand as scars of @entity2 's despair and anger . " you got your vote on ? " yelled @entity160 , a @entity37 supporter who was distributing campaign literature at @entity162 , the precinct closest to where @entity129 lived . some residents did have their vote on . they felt a duty to vote this year . one of them was @entity170 , 41 , who works as a planner for @entity172 . yes , she voted in presidential elections , but she never paid much mind to local races . until now . even though she was aware of the problems around her , @entity129 's killing , she said , woke her up . " it made me think of all the males in my family , " said @entity170 , who lives right off @entity150 . she was undecided about who to vote for until the last minute when she walked into the polling station with another voter and they discussed the race . @entity170 decided to cast her vote for @entity37 simply because he was a young man . she thought he had energy and was more in sync with @entity2 's youth . " i think he will be more open - minded , " she said after voting . changing the way @entity2 polices its people was no. 1 on many a voter 's agenda . even the candidates who take issue with the @entity68 report on @entity2 agreed that the city needed change when it came to policing . " we have to get out of this law enforcement for business , " said candidate @entity203 , coordinator of the computer network security program at @entity205 . @entity203 referred to the @entity68 's finding that @entity2 issued fines and traffic tickets to generate revenue for the city . " that 's not a good thing , " @entity203 said as he stood in the drizzle at a polling station , hoping to persuade voters who were still undecided . @entity217 , a 67 - year - old retired airline pilot , said he voted for @entity84 . if some residents saw @entity84 as part of the problem , @entity217 asked why no one complained when @entity84 was mayor . he said @entity129 's shooting brought a lot of bad things to light . " we did n't realize the effect some of the institutional problems had on poor people , " he said . " some things need to be changed , and we are aware of that . " by midafternoon , @entity84 said the numbers were looking good . at a church where voters from all three wards were casting ballots , @entity84 predicted a 40 % -50 % turnout . when the rain let up for a few minutes , a stream of voters trickled into the @entity242 in downtown @entity2 to cast their votes . @entity244 and @entity245 both voted for @entity84 's opponent , @entity92 , a political novice who attracted attention as a white man who routinely stood with protesters on the front lines . @entity92 likes to talk about how he married a black woman and has a biracial teenage son . " i wanted change , " said @entity255 , 60 , who is black . his wife is white . he said the couple moved to @entity2 after he retired from the @entity259 in 1995 because they felt it was a racially welcoming place . but now , after all the problems rose to the surface , it 's time for fresh blood on the council , @entity255 said . " quit using law enforcement as a revenue stream , " @entity255 said . " that 's like using the military to go into places and looting them . the police are supposed to keep order . " @entity273 came to vote with her husband and two little girls in tow . she voted for @entity30 , the former @entity45 cosmetics sales director . @entity66 echoed the thoughts of other @entity2 residents who experienced something new in this election : candidates coming to their door . past elections have not seen the kind of canvassing activity that took place in the last few weeks . nor have past municipal elections drawn so much media attention . " one thing we really liked is ( @entity30 ) came to our door and talked to us about her desire to make change in our neighborhood , " @entity66 said . " she 's going to be hands on . she lives in the neighborhood as well and has for the past 36 years . we were kind of taken by that . " the rain began to fall again as the @entity301 got in their car . it was expected to continue off and on through the day and night . but at about 5 , just when many voters were leaving work , the sun shone brilliantly . overheard at one precinct : good weather brought out the worst in @entity2 last august . maybe today , it would bring out the best .
