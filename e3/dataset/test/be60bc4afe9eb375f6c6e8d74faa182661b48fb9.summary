it also affects the treatment of @entity57 who settle in @entity3*****1
@entity15 is an example of the long reach of @entity3 imperialism*****1
@entity15 was for a brief period an incorporated province of @entity3 , on the model of @entity72 , and @entity15 families still feel the devastating effects of the fascist dictatorship 's persecution of those who resisted @entity3 occupation*****1
over 100,000 @entity15 men , women , and children were deported to concentration camps deep in the desert in the late 1920s and early 1930s , and much of the ruling class was exiled or executed*****0

until his death in 2011 , despite deals with @entity3 and the @entity124 to control departures from his borders , @entity84 intermittently used @entity7 fears of mass arrivals of migrants from @entity15 as a political weapon*****1
given @entity7 's geography , this weapon was pointed particularly at @entity3 , @entity15 's former master , and the principal target of @entity84 's post-colonial revenge politics*****1
few @entity3 learn about this colonial history and its legacies , even though episodes of racist violence against immigrants from former @entity3 colonies and elsewhere are on the rise*****1
upon her appointment in 2013 as minister of integration , @entity143 , an @entity3 of @entity145 origin , faced ugly racist attacks from fellow @entity3 politicians , including a comment that she looked like an orangutan*****0

the program rescued more than 160,000 migrants in one year before it was discontinued due to @entity124 budget restrictions*****0
it seems to reflect the conflicted attitude of the @entity3 government to its past aggressions : an admirable and courageous initiative -- advanced under an imperialist banner*****1
the @entity3 government deserves the full support of the @entity124 as it responds to the current humanitarian crisis*****1
but it also needs to address the failure of civic education about its colonial past*****1
at 40 years old , @entity3 prime minister @entity206 is of a different generation than those who have sustained a politics of selective memory that is as dangerous in its own way for migrants as the boats now capsizing in the @entity9*****1
setting a new course on this issue is in @entity3 's interest , now more than ever .*****1
