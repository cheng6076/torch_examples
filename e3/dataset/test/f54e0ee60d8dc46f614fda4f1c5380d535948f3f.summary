( @entity0 ) the best part of the @entity3 oral arguments about marriage equality was when justice @entity5 alluded to @entity6 . ok , she did n't actually mention @entity6 , but @entity5 talked about how the institution of marriage has already changed from long ago , when it was " a dominant and a subordinate relationship .

( @entity0 ) the best part of the @entity3 oral arguments about marriage equality was when justice @entity5 alluded to @entity6*****1
ok , she did n't actually mention @entity6 , but @entity5 talked about how the institution of marriage has already changed from long ago , when it was " a dominant and a subordinate relationship*****0
" " yes , it was marriage between a man and a woman , but the man decided where the couple would be domiciled , " said @entity5*****0
" it was her obligation to follow him*****0
" @entity19 , the attorney arguing on behalf of the four same - sex couples who petitioned the @entity3 , said in response : " that 's correct*****0
... for centuries we had and @entity25 had this coverture system where a woman 's legal identity was absorbed into that of her husband and men and women had different prescribed legal roles*****0
and again , because of equality and changing social circumstances , all of those gender differences in the rights and responsibilities of the married pair have been eliminated*****0
" @entity42 , wives were the legal property of their husbands and " marital rape " was not only not a crime but not even a concept*****0
to argue that the definition of marriage has not changed since then is either willfully ignorant or woefully naïve*****0
justice @entity50 , widely believed to be the key swing vote amidst a court otherwise generally evenly divided along ideological lines , at one point referred to " the nobility and the sacredness of marriage*****0
" which is true , if you ignore the history of its past and the reality of infidelity in the present*****0
if anything , the nobility and sacredness of marriage need protecting from straight people*****0
one downside to arguing that marriage has " always been " between a man and a woman is that , therefore , any problems in the institution of marriage are also plainly the responsibility of heterosexual couples , too*****0
the one justice who did n't ask a question is @entity83 , who , with one slight exception , has now gone over nine years without a single inquiry from the bench*****0
it should be carefully noted here that @entity83 is a black man married to a white woman*****0
anti-miscegenation laws banning interracial marriage were first introduced in 1661 in @entity92*****0
that means that by 1967 , when the @entity3 considered the constitutionality of such laws , bans against interracial marriage had been officially part of the @entity99 " definition " of marriage for over 300 years*****1
just 20 years after the @entity3 struck down the anti-miscegenation laws still in effect in 16 states , @entity83 and his wife , @entity105 , were married*****0
@entity106 , director of @entity107 at @entity108 , has written , " the fact that the @entity83 ' marriage required progressive @entity3 action must in some way inform their sense of this moment*****1
" or maybe not*****0
@entity83 did n't say one way or the other , though his remarks outside court and in dissenting opinions suggest he 's firmly opposed to the @entity3 doing for other loving relationships what it once did for his own*****0
but perhaps the example of @entity83 speaks to what seems most glaring about the oral arguments in the marriage equality cases , namely that just as with the rest of @entity99 , the @entity3 seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics*****1
perhaps this was always the case , justices hiding their personal beliefs behind legal rationales*****0
still , the marriage equality arguments seemed even more shaped by politics than the law*****1
on the one hand , pulling pages right from @entity141 presidential candidates , conservative chief justice @entity138 suggested the court should n't intervene in a state - driven social debate*****0
aping conservative religious activists , justice @entity145 asked whether four people could then get married*****0
on the other hand , justice @entity148 talked about marriage as a fundamental liberty while justice @entity152 pushed back on whether legalizing same - sex marriage would really harm or take anything away from opposite - sex couples*****0
both arguments , and the moral force beneath them , seemed to echo gay rights messaging*****0
still , the highly political and momentous decision in @entity160 was unanimous*****0
whichever way the court rules on same - sex marriage , it appears unlikely the ruling will be unanimous*****0
so , while the definition of marriage has unarguably evolved , a fact hopefully the @entity3 will soon confirm with a ruling in favor of marriage equality , what 's also clear is that the court has evolved*****1
blown by the winds of partisanship whipping up @entity99 in general , the @entity3 is increasingly divorced from reason and submissive to politics*****1
the question remains not what is fundamentally the right decision — i think both law and morality are clear in favor of equal treatment*****0
the question is simply which side of the court will dominate the other .*****0
