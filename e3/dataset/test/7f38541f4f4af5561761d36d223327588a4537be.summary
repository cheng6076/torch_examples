( @entity1 ) getting caught napping on the job is never good . getting caught napping on the job in the cargo hold of a plane takes it to a whole different level . @entity7 was just barely on its way to @entity9 from @entity10 on monday afternoon when the pilot reported hearing unusual banging from the cargo hold . " there could be a person in there so we 're going to come back around , " he told air traffic control . the banging in the cargo hold did come from a person and he turned out to be a ramp agent from @entity24 , a contractor for @entity7 that handles loading the luggage , the airline said . the man told authorities he had fallen asleep . it appears he was never in any danger . the cargo hold is pressurized and temperature controlled , the airline said . the plane was also only in the air for 14 minutes . the passengers knew something was n't right , almost as soon as the plane took off . " all of a sudden we heard all this pounding underneath the plane and we thought there was something wrong with the landing gear , " @entity38 told @entity1 affiliate @entity39 . the pounding grew louder . " at that point , we started hearing yelling , screams for help , very , very faint , " @entity46 said . " that 's when we notified the flight attendant that there was somebody underneath us . " as the banging continued , a federal air marshal sprang into action . " at some point , the marshal kind of made himself known , " said @entity57 . " he started banging back , and he yelled really loud and said , ' we 're getting ready to land , hold on to something . ' " the emergency landing spooked the folks aboard @entity7 . @entity63 spoke to @entity64 , another one of the passengers . " we just took off for @entity68 regular and then ... about five minutes into the flight the captain came on and said we were going back and we 'd land within five to seven minutes , and we did , " @entity64 said . " when we landed was when all the trucks and the police and the fire trucks surrounded the plane . " " i think it 's scary and really unsafe , too , " @entity75 told affiliate @entity76 . " because what if it 's someone who could have been a terrorist ? " the ramp agent appeared to be in ok after the ordeal . he was taken to an area hospital as a precaution , the airline said . he passed a drug test and was discharged . the employee started work at 5 a.m. and his shift was scheduled to end at 2:30 p.m. , just before the flight departed .
