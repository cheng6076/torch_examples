( @entity1 ) when @entity2 , author of " @entity3 " and a passionate advocate for fighting gender stereotypes , heard from a frustrated mom on @entity7 , she knew she needed to do something . so she shared the mom 's story . in a blog post , @entity2 told how the mom , @entity12 of @entity13 , @entity14 , wanted to buy " @entity17 " fabric to make pillows for her two children . the problem ? the fabric did n't include two of the heroes from the movie : the female characters , @entity24 and @entity25 . so @entity12 decided to send an email to @entity27 , the company that makes the fabric , saying that as a woman and an engineer , she was offended . she got an answer from the company but it did n't help . girl empowerment ads like @entity35 : do they work ? a licensing manager for @entity27 responded that the company has found that boys do n't want girl characters on their things . " @entity43 girls ! yuck ! haha , " the licensing manager wrote . it will come as no surprise that @entity12 was none too pleased to receive that response . " i was frustrated and disgusted that a manager , and a female manager too , would laugh off my initial contact with the company . it was unprofessional . so i responded , " @entity12 told @entity1 . she asked that we not use her last name , in order to maintain her privacy . in an email back to the company , @entity12 wrote , " by eliminating the women in your fabric design , you are telling boys that it 's ok to think girls are yucky , unworthy and less than a boy . " you are also telling girls they are unworthy , unwanted and that it 's un-cool to be smart and confident . " what happened next shows that parents , aided by social media outrage , may have more leverage to combat gender stereotyping in our culture than they realize . and the " @entity17 " example -- along with a similar recent one involving toms , the shoes retailer -- suggests that manufacturers may be finally getting it , too . first , the rest of the story about @entity27 and the " @entity17 " fabric : after sharing @entity12 's story with her readers and her 6,700 @entity89 followers , @entity2 encouraged people to give @entity27 a piece of their mind . she also invited them to tweet their own stories with the hashtag # @entity94 . women responded in droves , pointing out how @entity98 , the female character in the popular " @entity100 " superhero movie franchise , is often excluded from merchandise and how cereal boxes rarely include female characters . " this sends the direct message to both boys and girls that females are forgettable , unimportant , undesirable . what a horrible thing to teach our children ! " said @entity2 , who is also the founder and chief executive officer of @entity111 , a company that makes empowering clothing for boys and girls . " the prevailing theory is , 1 . boys are the default audience , and 2 . boys wo n't want an item with a girl on it , " @entity2 said . " yet , i talk with thousands of parents every week who say otherwise . " why trying to make our kids happy can backfire those parents are clearly making their voices heard . because not too long after @entity12 received her initial response from @entity27 , @entity2 said she got a call from the company , asking her to post a statement from @entity27 on her site . " it is sometimes difficult to hear negative feedback but the message was clear and we intend to act upon your message , " the statement read . " most importantly , @entity27 does not condone sexism in any shape or form and does not design products to shine a negative light on females or males . " the company said it would be talking with @entity148 " immediately " about additional designs for " @entity17 " that would incorporate all the characters . " we would never intentionally offend any segment of the population . we are a strong company with positive morals and values and we respect and see both genders equally , " said the statement . @entity27 told @entity1 it would have no further comment . @entity12 said she was surprised the company responded so quickly . " i do not believe this would have happened without the @entity111 and @entity160 community also raising their voices . " the real @entity163 : when will women 's teams get equal buzz ? around the same time , @entity2 heard from another follower about an issue with toms and wrote about it on her site . on the normally progressive retailer 's web landing page for kids were photos that some parents felt played into gender stereotypes . one photo suggested " @entity182 " shoes for boys , and the other , this one on a pink background , included the caption " @entity184 : adorn their feet for spring . " " really , toms ? girls are not ornaments we adorn . girls play , too ! " @entity2 wrote on her @entity7 page . two hours later , @entity2 received a comment from toms on her @entity7 page , saying that the company completely agrees and that the wording has been changed to now say " new arrivals for kids . " " we 're really grateful whenever our community brings something like this to our attention , " said @entity195 , senior vice president , global marketing and communications for toms . " perhaps as much or more than any other brand , i mean we really listen to our customers in our community . " so , here 's my question : are the two speedy responses from companies after women spoke out on social media more a sign that companies are truly getting it about gender stereotypes and girl and boy empowerment , or more a sign of the power of parents ? or are they a mixture of both ? how to @entity221 # @entity220 @entity2 said there 's no doubt that companies are in business to protect their bottom line , and that will always be a motivator . but she said these back - to - back incidents show what can happen when parents make it clear they wo n't buy products from companies that sell gender stereotypes . " ' be not silent ' is my mantra . speak up ! " @entity2 said . " the success with @entity27 and @entity238 and other wins we 've had in the past is an example of the power of parents ( moms and dads ) and children 's advocates aggregating their voices to say , ' enough is enough . ' " @entity12 said it 's a sign of the power of parents becoming " more aware , reactive and using social media to make their voices heard by companies that market to children . " she added , " one voice can be dismissed ; the hailstorm of voices collectively can not be ignored so easily . " it is clear , from these two examples , that parents using their voices online and with their wallets can encourage companies to change . there 's no question that raising awareness about stereotypes helps , said @entity2 . " if companies are n't paying attention by now , they most certainly should be . " @entity272 , princess - y and sexy too soon do you think more companies are getting the message to include girl characters on merchandise ? share your thoughts with @entity280 on @entity89 or @entity281 on @entity7 .
