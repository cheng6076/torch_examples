( @entity1 ) @entity0 is coming to @entity2 . in the next few weeks the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) will begin to negotiate in earnest with the city to restructure the police department , which the department has charged with engaging in a pattern and practice of racial discrimination . it should not be forgotten that the @entity3 review of the @entity13 was precipitated by months of protests and activism following the killing of @entity17 by a @entity2 police officer and by revelations about the town 's dysfunctional government and court system by local civil rights law groups . now , after a half year of unrest , and with citizens on tuesday electing two new black city council members , change is beginning to come to @entity2 . the question is , what kind of change ? the report from the @entity3 offered a devastating insight into a police department and court system that preyed on its own citizens . through illegal traffic stops and arrests , and the use of excessive force , the police department held town residents in bondage . the municipal court system used excessive court fines and fees to ensure that citizens arrested for even minor infractions would be charged thousands of dollars or face jail time . court costs and fees constituted the second - largest sources of revenue for the town . rather than a force for public safety , the @entity13 became , according to attorney general @entity55 , " a collection agency " -- one that preyed disproportionately on the town 's @entity59 residents . the evidence of ugly and explicit racial discrimination was devastating . it included blatantly racist emails traded among officers , and evidence that african - americans were victims in all of the police canine bite incidents recorded by the department . but just a few weeks before the release of the report , the @entity2 police chief declared there were " no racial issues " in his department . @entity2 's ugly , racist emails released the recommendations in the report , ranging from new training and supervision of police officers , addressing racially discriminatory conduct to structural revisions in the court system , will , if implemented , remake the law enforcement system in the town . ( a grand jury that investigated the shooting of @entity17 by officer @entity89 chose not to file charges against him and the @entity3 also did n't find reason to prosecute . ) without question , change is coming to the town 's government . town manager @entity100 , @entity2 's most powerful official and , until the @entity3 's blistering report , the one who inexplicably managed to elude public scrutiny , resigned weeks ago and has been replaced by the city 's deputy manager . three sitting city council members chose not to run for office again and , on tuesday , citizens elected two black candidates to the city council , changing its racial composition : five of six members and the mayor were white . now the council will be 50 % black . @entity2 's hapless police chief @entity116 also finally resigned after holding on through a months - long display of astonishing incompetence . the department first drew the attention of the nation for its display of military weaponry and tear gas in response to civilian protests . the appointment of a commander from the @entity130 was deemed necessary to begin quelling the unrest and to build community trust in the early days of the protest . @entity116 's departure sent an important signal to the population of a town preyed upon by officers under his command . and so we can be certain that along with the new makeup of the city council , there will be a new police chief in @entity2 . but does that mean that fundamental change will come to @entity2 ?

( @entity1 ) @entity0 is coming to @entity2*****0
in the next few weeks the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) will begin to negotiate in earnest with the city to restructure the police department , which the department has charged with engaging in a pattern and practice of racial discrimination*****1
it should not be forgotten that the @entity3 review of the @entity13 was precipitated by months of protests and activism following the killing of @entity17 by a @entity2 police officer and by revelations about the town 's dysfunctional government and court system by local civil rights law groups*****0
now , after a half year of unrest , and with citizens on tuesday electing two new black city council members , change is beginning to come to @entity2*****1
the question is , what kind of change ? the report from the @entity3 offered a devastating insight into a police department and court system that preyed on its own citizens*****0
through illegal traffic stops and arrests , and the use of excessive force , the police department held town residents in bondage*****0
the municipal court system used excessive court fines and fees to ensure that citizens arrested for even minor infractions would be charged thousands of dollars or face jail time*****0
court costs and fees constituted the second - largest sources of revenue for the town*****0
rather than a force for public safety , the @entity13 became , according to attorney general @entity55 , " a collection agency " -- one that preyed disproportionately on the town 's @entity59 residents*****0
the evidence of ugly and explicit racial discrimination was devastating*****1
it included blatantly racist emails traded among officers , and evidence that african - americans were victims in all of the police canine bite incidents recorded by the department*****0
but just a few weeks before the release of the report , the @entity2 police chief declared there were " no racial issues " in his department*****1
@entity2 's ugly , racist emails released the recommendations in the report , ranging from new training and supervision of police officers , addressing racially discriminatory conduct to structural revisions in the court system , will , if implemented , remake the law enforcement system in the town*****0
( a grand jury that investigated the shooting of @entity17 by officer @entity89 chose not to file charges against him and the @entity3 also did n't find reason to prosecute*****0
) without question , change is coming to the town 's government*****0
town manager @entity100 , @entity2 's most powerful official and , until the @entity3 's blistering report , the one who inexplicably managed to elude public scrutiny , resigned weeks ago and has been replaced by the city 's deputy manager*****1
three sitting city council members chose not to run for office again and , on tuesday , citizens elected two black candidates to the city council , changing its racial composition : five of six members and the mayor were white*****1
now the council will be 50 % black*****1
@entity2 's hapless police chief @entity116 also finally resigned after holding on through a months - long display of astonishing incompetence*****0
the department first drew the attention of the nation for its display of military weaponry and tear gas in response to civilian protests*****0
the appointment of a commander from the @entity130 was deemed necessary to begin quelling the unrest and to build community trust in the early days of the protest*****0
@entity116 's departure sent an important signal to the population of a town preyed upon by officers under his command*****0
and so we can be certain that along with the new makeup of the city council , there will be a new police chief in @entity2*****1
but does that mean that fundamental change will come to @entity2 ? not necessarily*****0
not unless protest and activism during this critical period turns to influence the vitally important opportunities that lie ahead in the coming weeks*****0
the @entity3 's full - on negotiations with the leadership in @entity2 will determine the shape of the new @entity13*****0
indeed , the @entity3 report alludes to the possibility of disbanding the department in favor of a regional policing integration with @entity160*****0
many local activists have suggested just such a solution , but given ongoing problems with policing in the county -- including the role of county forces in some of the most controversial clashes with activists in @entity2 last fall -- community representatives will have to fight hard to ensure that the @entity3 can fold @entity171 into its monitoring and reform process*****0
equally important were the april 7 general elections*****0
turnout in municipal elections has been notoriously low in @entity2 , with white voters nearly three times more likely to turn out than african - americans*****0
but local groups had engaged in vigorous voter registration and get - out - the - vote campaigns*****0
. the mayor has two years left to his term and has defiantly insisted that he will not resign ( although a petition for his recall has been circulating )*****0
that means that he will be a lead voice in negotiating with the @entity3 to remake the police department*****0
has he committed to a clear set of principles that will guide his participation in those talks ? community activists and residents must ensure that mayor @entity195 plans to represent their vision of new @entity13*****0
but there is an opportunity to begin thinking about even more ambitious structural change in @entity2 and throughout @entity160*****0
@entity2 's governing structure , with a strong city manager and a weak council and mayor , mirrors that of thousands of other suburbs in the @entity204*****1
that form of governance might have been precisely what thriving , middle class white suburbanites wanted when they fled racial integration in cities like @entity171*****1
but working class suburbs like @entity2 with a majority black population in which the needs of the population in the areas of education and economic opportunity more closely hews to the needs of urban residents , may need a more robust form of governance*****1
in any case , a system in which the elected officials have minimal power , but non-elected leaders , like the town manager and the chief of police , have inordinate power , is a recipe for the kind of unaccountable , non-representative government that controlled @entity2 's residents*****1
yet this precise form of government is in wide use across the country*****0
likewise , @entity242 , like the vast majority of states , holds municipal elections in non-presidential election years , guaranteeing a significantly lower voter turnout -- although only a few states hold the primary and general election in march and april as @entity242 law requires @entity2 to do*****0
it 's not that @entity2 is so different than towns across @entity204*****1
it 's precisely because @entity2 holds up a mirror to flaws in our democratic system of government in towns across this country that the stakes are so high*****0
@entity2 residents now have the opportunity to begin a movement for change in the other 89 jurisdictions in @entity160 plagued by similar governance flaws , including those towns led by @entity59*****0
and @entity2 's example should provoke self - examination in working class suburbs across the country , where the power and effectiveness of weak elected local government is inadequate to meet the needs of the population*****1
@entity0 is coming to @entity2*****0
but the scope and breadth of that change will depend upon the ambition and discipline of activists and residents , whose passion and tenacity have already transformed the trajectory of leadership in a typical @entity59 town .*****0
