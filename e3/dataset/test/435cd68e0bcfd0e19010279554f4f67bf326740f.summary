( @entity0 ) hey , look what i did . that small boast on social media can trigger a whirlwind that spins into real - life grief , as a @entity9 veterinarian found out after shooting a cat . dr. @entity11 allegedly shot an arrow into the back of an orange tabby 's head and posted a proud photo this week on @entity17 of herself smiling , as she dangled its limp body by the arrow 's shaft . @entity11 added a comment , @entity0 affiliate @entity21 reported . " my first bow kill , lol . the only good feral tomcat is one with an arrow through it 's head ! vet of the year award ... gladly accepted . " callers rang the phones hot at @entity32 's @entity31 , where @entity11 worked , to vent their outrage . web traffic crashed its website . high price of public shaming on the internet then an animal rescuer said that @entity11 's prey was probably not a feral cat but the pet of an elderly couple , who called him " @entity45 . " he had gone missing on wednesday , the same day that @entity11 posted the photo of the slain cat . @entity0 has not been able to confirm the claim . as the firestorm grew , @entity11 wrote in the comments underneath her post : " no i did not lose my job . lol . @entity53 . like someone would get rid of me . i 'm awesome ! " that prediction was wrong . the clinic fired @entity11 , covered her name on its marquee with duct tape , and publicly distanced itself from her actions . " our goal now is to go on and try to fix our black eye and hope that people are reasonable and understand that those actions do n't anyway portray what we 're for here at @entity69 , " said dr. @entity61 . " we put our heart and soul into this place . " the clinic told @entity74 that @entity11 was not available for comment . @entity0 is reaching out to her . she removed her controversial post then eventually shut down her @entity17 page . callers also complained to the @entity79 and @entity80 , as her @entity17 post went viral . the sheriff 's office in @entity84 , where the cat was apparently shot , is investigating , and @entity11 could face charges . its dispatchers were overloaded with calls , the sheriff posted on @entity17 . " we are asking you to please take it easy on our dispatchers . as soon as the investigation is complete , we will post the relevant information here on this page , " the post read . animal rights activists are pushing for charges . " animal cruelty must be taken seriously , and the guilty parties should be punished to the fullest extent of the law , " said cat advocacy activist @entity102 . her organization , @entity107 , is offering a $ 7,500 reward for evidence leading to the arrest and conviction of the person who shot the cat . but others stood up for @entity11 . " she 's amazing . she 's caring , " said customer @entity115 . " she 's a good vet , so maybe her bad choice of posting something on @entity17 was not good . but i do n't think she should be judged for it .
