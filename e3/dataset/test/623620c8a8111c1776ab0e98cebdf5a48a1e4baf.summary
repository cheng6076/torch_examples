" i 've seen it before , " the former governor of @entity11 and possible presidential contender said . " history is full of examples where the inevitable frontrunner was inevitable right up until she was no longer or he was no longer inevitable . " @entity17 was considered inevitable to win the nomination in 2008 but ended up losing to @entity19 . @entity0 had previously dropped the inevitability comment in a television interview last month . the former governor , who capped off his two - day trip to the first - in - the - nation caucus state with a speech to the @entity26 @entity8 in @entity1 , said that although @entity17 is an " eminently qualified candidate , " the @entity8 is full of " good leaders . " " history is full of examples where people who are not very well known nationally can be very well known once they are willing to make their case to the people of @entity2 , " @entity0 said . in some polls , he has scored in the low single digits in the state . in a march @entity3 / @entity37 poll of national democrats , only 1 % picked @entity0 . in a january poll by @entity40 and the @entity41 , @entity0 was also at 1 % among @entity2 democrats . @entity17 , who leads most polls by upwards of 40 points , is planning to launch her presidential candidacy on sunday through a video message on social media , a person close to her campaign - in - waiting told @entity3 on friday . while he would n't say much about @entity17 , when asked about her candidacy , @entity0 said , " if leaders believe that they have the experience and the framework to move our country forward , they should run . and they should engage with voters and our country would be the better for it . " @entity0 , like other @entity8 , appears to refrain from directly attacking @entity17 . although last month on @entity62 , he said that the presidency is " not some crown to be passed between two families , " he has not focused on her . he has , however , openly teased a presidential run . " i know that , as @entity8 , we expect -- and i have heard this all over the country -- the @entity8 expect a robust conversation about the issues we face as a nation and the challenges we face , " he said . " they believe that that conversation needs to take place in something as important as a presidential primary . " he concluded : " it would be an extreme poverty indeed if there was only one person willing to compete for our party 's nomination for president . "
