( @entity2 ) in baseball , there 's a traditional comeback after a tough season : " wait ' til next year ! " for climate change " next year " is now*****0
this year is the time and the @entity8 ' international climate negotiations in @entity9 in december are the place to secure strong global agreement to curb heat - trapping emissions*****0
a successful climate pact will send a signal around the world that a shift to a low - carbon economy is underway*****0
the @entity18 has made clear that it is ready to step up to the plate on climate change*****0
the @entity18 administration on tuesday unveiled details about its proposal to reduce @entity18 greenhouse gas emissions by 26 % to 28 % below 2005 levels by 2025*****1
this common - sense and achievable plan to decarbonize the @entity18 economy will result in significant cost savings from cleaner technologies and create more @entity18 energy jobs to power our homes and businesses*****1
this is an area where the @entity18 needs to lead , and doing so will create a better planet for our children and a more prosperous future for our country*****1
the @entity18 is n't alone in this global climate effort*****1
in a landmark joint announcement with the @entity18 in november , @entity42 unveiled its intent to peak its carbon emissions around 2030 and to double its share of zero - carbon energy to 20 %*****1
this shift will require substantial effort from @entity42 to retool its economy , increase investment in renewable energy and divest from coal*****1
as the world 's no. 1 investor in renewable energy , @entity42 has already taken important steps forward*****0
at the same time , @entity58 has set the audacious goal of installing 100 gigawatts of solar power capacity by 2022 , a 30-fold increase from current levels and eight times more solar capacity than the @entity18 has today*****1
cities and corporations are joining in as well*****1
more than 200 cities , home to 436 million people , have voluntarily committed to saving 13 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury*****1
and more than a thousand companies , along with 73 countries , voiced support for putting a price on carbon and moving to cleaner energy technologies*****0
leading companies , like @entity79 and @entity80 , are making major bets on renewable energy*****0
and another 25 businesses have signed onto the @entity85 ' principles — these companies represent energy demand equal to more than 1 million homes*****0
increasing examples demonstrate that strong climate action can be good for the economy*****0
for instance , renewable sources now provide one - fifth of the world 's electricity , while solar manufacturing costs have dropped 80 % in the last seven years*****0
wind turbines installed now are 100 times better at generating power than turbines were 30 years ago*****0
clean technology investments surged to $ 310 billion last year*****0
in the @entity18 , carbon emissions fell by 10 % from 2007 to 2013 , the largest absolute emissions reduction recorded , even as the @entity18 has recovered from the @entity103*****1
many of these shifts are unprecedented and could not have been anticipated even five years ago*****0
yet these trends alone are not enough to counter the mounting climate - related impacts that we are already seeing*****0
a global climate agreement in @entity9 this december can send more signals to markets and drive more ambitious climate action for decades to come*****0
a @entity9 agreement would represent a new form of international cooperation and a fundamental change in the global approach to climate action — a shift from burden - sharing to the creation of mutual opportunities ; from cost to investment ; from economic threat to a spur to economic development*****0
with the @entity18 showing the way , and with cooperation from other countries , businesses , investors , cities and citizens , we can achieve a prosperous and secure future for all*****1
each year , baseball returns and hope springs eternal*****0
now , it 's time for all countries to get in the game .*****0
