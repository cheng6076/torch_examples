( @entity1 ) @entity0 is now officially a candidate for president -- and the never ending @entity4 story rumbles on*****1
she has been a part of all our lives now for approaching a quarter of a century*****0
she started as the first lady that the right loved to hate , then the deceived wife , next a senator , then a candidate for president in one of the most dynamic primaries in history and finally , a secretary of state*****1
the @entity16 have their aristocratic @entity17 , the @entity18 have their @entity19*****0
and if @entity0 or @entity20 were to win two presidential terms , then in the 44 years from 1981 to 2025 , 28 will have had a @entity4 or a @entity22 in the @entity23*****0
the great @entity25 republic now looks about as democratic as " @entity26*****0
" but even though @entity0 has been around nearly my entire lifetime , @entity29 may speak for many when it asks : " what does @entity0 stand for ? " there is a paradox she presents : she is by far the best - known presidential candidate across both parties and , for the moment , almost unchallenged within her own*****1
yet even though @entity35 can assert confidently that @entity0 " does n't ' need ' ( the @entity23 )*****0
but she wants it " -- the question unanswered is " what for ? " and for liberals , who believe that government is there to do something , it 's this lack of definition that is surely so disconcerting about @entity4*****0
there are good grounds for a liberal primary challenge to @entity4*****1
the economy has revived under @entity49 but , say critics , largely to the benefit of @entity52 and the super-rich*****0
the riots in @entity55 , @entity56 , were a painful reminder that the poor , particularly the nonwhite poor , have been left behind*****0
@entity4 's credentials as a fighter against inequality are mixed*****0
it is true , as the @entity63 notes , that she has previously called for " universal prekindergarten , equal pay for women , increases in the minimum wage , paid family leave , higher taxes on the wealthy and an expanded @entity72 for working - poor families*****0
" but she counts among her friends precisely those corporate people blamed by the occupy crowd for the country 's inequality*****0
@entity4 is now , wisely , trying to distance herself from the @entity80 -- after all , its fundraising efforts among foreign interests are hardly the stuff of populist liberalism*****0
then there is her foreign policy record*****0
@entity4 voted in 2002 to authorize the @entity98 ( though in her memoir last year , she backed away from the vote , writing that she " got it wrong*****0
" ) as secretary of state , she is easily associated in the mind of the left with such controversies as the war in @entity91 , the crisis in @entity93 and the collapse of the @entity96 regime in @entity97*****0
that some of these may have had little to do with her is beside the point*****0
@entity4 is going to have to spend a sizeable amount of time during the primaries explaining and defending the things that occurred while she was working for the @entity49 administration*****0
her personal ethics are on the agenda , too -- as demonstrated by the flap over her use of a private email account*****0
these are the issues that her @entity18 rivals are running on*****1
in @entity126 last week , both @entity124 and @entity125 attacked @entity52 , @entity124 adding that he had also opposed the @entity98*****0
both men questioned the wisdom of clintonian triangulation -- the idea that the @entity23 can be won , and the country successfully governed , by always seeking the middle ground*****0
both men would be wise to focus on @entity126 ; to contrast a populist , folksy campaign with the distant , over-managed style of @entity4*****0
and both would do well to tap into a feeling that it would be unhealthy , undemocratic and plain dull to let @entity138 to the nomination without a proper challenge*****0
nevertheless , there is a strange contradiction between the constant assertions that @entity18 want a race and the polling evidence that @entity4 would beat anyone who tried to take her on*****0
why do liberals demand a conversation about policy if the only answer they can still come up with is @entity0 ? the explanation is that the @entity18 is intellectually impoverished*****1
we hear often of the @entity16 's problems , how out of touch with a changing electorate it is and how it is divided against itself*****0
the @entity18 ' challenges , however , are just as substantial*****0
they 've just been masked by having a charismatic man in the @entity23 dominating the national conversation*****0
@entity49 was elected at one of the highest points of national @entity18 popularity*****0
but , since then , @entity18 power has been whittled away in successive congressional and local elections -- leaving the party without significant representation in the @entity172 and absent any mildly conservative support at all*****0
everything was staked on @entity175 , which was ambitious and noble venture but without an obvious second act to follow*****0
@entity18 have become about defending the honor and reputation of their president rather than proposing bold new reforms*****1
and the mood of their base can be felt either in the violence in @entity56 or the disaffected , hollow laughter of " @entity187 " audience*****0
cynicism abounds*****0
who really imagines that @entity0 is the kind of personality that can spark a renaissance of thinking or a rejuvenation of activism among liberals ? to repeat the question : what is she exactly running for ? if she has one trump card to play , however , it is reinvention*****1
recall that she started the 2008 primaries out as a moderate , play - it - safe frontrunner and ended them drinking beer in an @entity207 bar -- reinvented , in the words of @entity49 , as @entity209*****0
if there is little intellectualism left in liberalism , at least @entity0 is clever*****0
which is why she remains an asset to her party .*****0
