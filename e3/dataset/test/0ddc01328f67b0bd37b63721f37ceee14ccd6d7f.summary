@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) we came on a commercial flight to @entity0*****0
blue tarps were visible from the sky for people to hide under -- signs that there was something wrong*****0
we had to circle the airport for a couple of hours*****0
there were a couple of issues*****0
there was an aftershock this afternoon , so they were checking the runway for damage*****0
military and aid flights have priority , and a few military planes -- @entity26 military planes -- were going in , trying to bring in aid*****0
whether they did is unclear*****0
when we landed at the airport , it was wet and cold*****0
a couple of thousand people were lining the road to the entrance to the airport trying to get out*****0
but there 's no way to get out , really*****0
there were torrential rainstorms for a couple of hours , and with the strong aftershock a couple of hours ago , no one wants to go inside*****0
the residents of @entity0 sure do n't*****0
you can see some structural damage to buildings*****0
most buildings are not up to high construction standards*****0
fallen : @entity1 's historic landmarks driving through the city , there 's not a huge amount of visible damage*****1
there 's some damage to houses and buildings , but it 's not as visual as the @entity60 earthquake ( of 2010 )*****1
we were able to drive the main road to the hotel we 're staying at , but they 're not allowing anyone inside because of the aftershocks*****0
the guests are in a big tent used for functions on the lawn*****0
people are squeezed in*****0
there are probably about 100 people in there*****0
the tents are covered , but water is seeping in from streets puddled with water , especially around the edges of the tent*****0
so people are outside in the rain with no shelter*****0
it 's visually stark , with people in the streets*****0
it 's colder than usual this time of year*****0
i 'm cold and damp*****0
when it 's almost may , it 's usually much hotter*****0
there 's very little power in the city -- no power to speak of , no drinking water*****1
for the residents , it 's really bad*****1
very soon , they will need shelter*****0
temporary shelters have been put up , but very few -- 16 -- by the government*****0
it looks like a city where buildings have been abandoned*****0
people are hanging out in public squares and at intersections to avoid rubble from buildings*****0
those who survived -- and those who did n't there are issues with fuel in the city , and driving in , all the stores were shuttered*****0
you occasionally see a cart with food or a few bottles of drinking water , but for the most part , nothing is being sold in the city*****1
i do n't think they 're very concerned about looting , and there 's no military in the streets , but they will have to get water and food in the city soon*****1
communal kitchens have been set up for cooking*****0
not by the government -- people set them up on their own*****0
people are beside themselves in shock*****0
their biggest concern now is the structures , needing a place for shelter , to hide from the elements and sleep*****0
food will become the biggest concern in the coming days*****0
@entity0 is n't the epicenter though*****0
no one 's sure what it 's like at the epicenter*****1
people have n't been able to get to outlying areas*****0
we have n't been able to corroborate this , but the people we 're talking to here say there 's damage to the villages outside @entity0 -- thousands of houses damaged to the north , closer to the epicenter*****1
