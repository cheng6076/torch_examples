( @entity1 ) president @entity0 took part in a roundtable discussion this week on climate change , refocusing on the issue from a public health vantage point . after the event at @entity9 's @entity8 on tuesday , @entity0 sat down with me for a one - on - one interview . i asked him about the science behind climate change and public health and the message he wants the average @entity16 to take away , as well as how enforceable his action plan is . here are five things i learned : the president enrolled at @entity20 in @entity21 in 1979 ( he transferred to @entity22 his junior year ) . while in @entity21 , he said , the air was so bad that it prevented him from running outside . he remembers the air quality alerts and how people with respiratory problems had to stay inside . he credits the @entity27 with making @entity16 " a lot " healthier , in addition to being able to " see the mountains in the background because they are n't covered in smog . " @entity0 also said the instances of asthma and other respiratory diseases went down after these measures were taken . peer - reviewed @entity38 studies say that the @entity27 and subsequent amendments have reduced early deaths associated with exposure to ambient fine particle pollution and ozone , and reduced illnesses such as chronic bronchitis and acute myocardial infarction . the @entity38 estimates that , between 1970 and 2010 , the act and its amendments prevented 365,000 early deaths from particulate matter alone . " no challenge poses more of a public threat than climate change , " the president told me . when i asked about the strength of the science supporting the direct relationship between climate change and public health , he said , " we know as temperatures rise , insect - borne diseases potentially start shifting up . we know , in a very straight - forward fashion , that heatstroke and other heat - related illnesses and deaths potentially increase , and so what we 're doing here is to make sure that in addition to public awareness around the potential for big storms like @entity75 or big wildfires or droughts , that people recognize there 's a very personal , potential impact in climate change , and the good news is we can do something about it . " in many ways , @entity0 is attempting to reframe the discussion around climate change as a public health issue that affects all of us , while conceding that we do n't fully understand the magnitude of the correlation between rising temperatures and impact on human health . when asked what the average @entity16 can do about all this , the president encouraged ordinary citizens , doctors and nurses to start putting some pressure on elected officials " to try and make something happen to reduce the impacts of climate change . " he also issued a presidential proclamation declaring april 6 - 12 as @entity106 " to better understand , communicate and reduce the health impacts of climate change on our communities . " the average @entity16 can also do their part to reduce their own carbon footprint , including : change your incandescent light bulbs to compact fluorescent lights . one @entity114 can reduce up to 1,300 pounds of carbon dioxide pollution during its lifetime . if every house in the @entity16 switched its bulbs , we could reduce the electricity spent on lighting by half . unplug your gadgets and chargers when not in use . according to the @entity16 @entity127 , this practice can save $ 100 a year on your energy bill . use a laptop instead of a desktop . laptops are designed to be energy - efficient , because battery life is a major factor in their design . according to @entity137 , a laptop can be up to 80 % more energy - efficient than a desktop . filter your own water . beyond the environmental toll of plastic waste , consider just how far your water was transported before you bought it at the grocery store . adjust your curtains and thermostats . if you keep your house 2 degrees warmer in the summer and 2 degrees colder in the winter , you can save big bucks on your energy bill . the @entity127 estimates you can save up to 15 % on your bill by turning off your thermostat when you 're not at home . @entity0 did not appear particularly concerned about the current @entity154 challenge to the @entity155 . he said he believes the statute is " clear and straightforward . " he said , " i am not anticipating the @entity154 would make such a bad decision . " at issue is the 32 states that did not set up their own health care exchanges and left it to the federal government to do so . the plaintiffs in the lawsuit contend that the language of the @entity155 does not allow for tax subsidies in those states ( without state - based exchanges ) , possibly creating a situation , for example , in which people in @entity173 would receive a tax credit , but people living in @entity177 would not . @entity0 did tell me that if the @entity154 challenge is upheld , however , there is no @entity181 " millions of people would lose their health insurance . they would no longer be able to afford the health insurance that 's being provided out there . " @entity0 went on to say , " i think this is the last gasp of folks who have been fighting against [ the @entity155 ] for ideological reasons . " he told me that he " gets letters every day from people who say , ' you know what , the @entity155 saved my life or saved my kid 's life because i got insurance . ' ' i thought i was healthy ; turns out i had a tumor , but because i went and got a checkup , it was removed in time , and i 'm now cancer - free .

beyond the environmental toll of plastic waste , consider just how far your water was transported before you bought it at the grocery store*****0
adjust your curtains and thermostats*****0
if you keep your house 2 degrees warmer in the summer and 2 degrees colder in the winter , you can save big bucks on your energy bill*****0
