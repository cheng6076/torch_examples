below is an edited version of our conversation*****0
@entity2 : tell me about the woman who inspired your work*****0
@entity72 : i grew up with a girl named @entity74 who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 30*****0
she was a single mother of four children and i was a young mom with two kids*****0
and it was scary*****0
you just want to be there to watch them grow up*****0
paying the bills , cleaning her home , making dinner for her kids -- all of that became a real struggle*****0
i wanted to make things as easy as possible for her*****0
so when i would go to the store , i 'd grab an extra @entity94 and extra toilet paper*****0
when i would make my meals for my family , i would double it and bring a meal over to her house*****0
once i helped with an electric bill*****0
i just tried to do those little things that i hoped would relieve her of some stress*****0
about six months after she passed , we got to thinking she could n't have been the only one*****0
there were other people like her that needed help*****0
and that 's how @entity32 was born*****0
@entity2 : i 'd imagine that many people have n't thought about the struggles of being a single parent with cancer*****1
how are you able to help ? @entity72 : we focus on day - to - day support -- financial assistance , housecleaning , prepared meals , supplies for the home , kids ' events*****0
it 's that old - fashioned mentality of neighbors helping neighbors*****0
who does n't like a clean house that they did n't have to clean themselves ? we have a team of volunteers that have all been background - checked and they sweep , mop , clean the bathrooms*****0
we even have a couple of volunteers who go way above and beyond and will do laundry and fold clothes*****0
and so , our parents can come home from chemo , sit on the couch and read a book with their child without having to worry about , " ugh , the bathroom needs to be cleaned*****0
" it 's just to allow them to focus on what 's important , which is their health and their family*****0
@entity2 : is this work hard for you sometimes , on a personal level ? @entity72 : about 80 % of the parents we support are stage 4 , which means that battling cancer is their full - time job*****1
they will not go back to work and for the rest of their lives , they 'll be in treatment*****0
it 's hard*****0
it 's a rollercoaster*****0
i 've had bouts when a certain mom has passed where i did n't get out of bed for two weeks*****0
and i thought , " why am i doing this ? " but then i come back and remember why*****0
and so , while @entity74 is and always will be our inspiration , there are now so many others that are just as inspirational*****0
they 're why i keep doing what i do*****0
@entity2 : we should note that name of the organization is no longer entirely accurate*****0
@entity72 : we 're not just about moms -- we have dads , too ! not a lot , but if you are a single parent , you need the support*****0
they tend to even get a little special treatment*****0
everybody 's like , " oh , there 's a dad here*****0
" and so they give them lots of hugs and pay a lot of attention to them*****0
@entity2 : it 's such a serious subject , but your group seems to have a very fun vibe*****0
@entity72 : we 're very social ! once a month , all of our families come to pick up their supplies*****0
we do crafts with the kids , snacks and have a good time*****0
we like having any event because cancer sucks , and there 's not a lot of happy that goes with that*****0
but life does still go on , so it 's really important that these families can just de-stress and have fun*****0
no one can understand what they 're going through like another single parent with cancer*****1
so giving them the opportunity to meet and support each other is very powerful*****0
cancer can be so defeating*****0
it 's an ugly word and it 's a sad word*****0
and so , it 's my hope that @entity32 can bring joy and say to cancer , " you ca n't defeat us*****0
we are still going to be strong and we 're going to celebrate life*****0
and you ca n't take that away from us*****0
