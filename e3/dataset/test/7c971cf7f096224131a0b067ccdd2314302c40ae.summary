the front row is reserved for his family*****0
some days , none of his relatives is there*****0
but when his mother , fiancée , brother and other friends attend , he winks , nods , smiles , jokes , laughs , flirts with his fiancée and mouths greetings to them including " ' thanks for coming ' and ' i love you*****0

it 's not unusual for his lawyers to slap him on his back and huddle before court begins , appearing at ease*****0
they 've been representing him since june 2013*****0
