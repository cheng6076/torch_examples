( @entity8 ) the investigation into the crash of @entity7 has not revealed evidence of the co-pilot @entity10 's motive , but he suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in @entity3 , @entity4 , said monday*****1
investigators have not found any writings or conversations where @entity10 shared his motives or confessed to any plans , prosecutor 's spokesman @entity15 said*****0
however , medical records reveal that @entity10 was suicidal at one time and underwent psychotherapy*****0
this was before he ever got his pilot 's license , @entity15 said*****0
@entity15 emphasized there 's no evidence suggesting @entity10 was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash*****1
it is believed that @entity10 locked the captain out of the cockpit and deliberately crashed the plane tuesday into the @entity35 , killing all 150 on board*****0
the prosecutor 's office confirmed what some media outlets had reported about doctors deeming @entity10 unfit to fly , though there were no physical illnesses found*****1
in short , investigators in @entity4 and @entity45 are not yet ruling anything out*****1
much attention has focused on @entity10 's state of mind , with suggestions that he may have had mental health issues*****1
@entity10 , 27 , passed his annual pilot recertification medical examination in summer 2014 , a @entity4 aviation source told @entity8*****0
he had stated working as a commercial pilot in 2013 , @entity54 said*****0
an official with @entity54 , which owns @entity58 , said that the exam only tests physical health , not psychological health*****0
it 's unknown if @entity10 mentioned his problems on a form that asks yes - or - no questions about physical and mental illness , suicide attempts and medications*****1
@entity70 pilots must fill out the form to be recertified*****1
federal aviation authorities , not the airline , issue the form*****0
the form is privileged information and @entity54 never sees a pilot 's completed form , said an airline spokesperson*****0
the airline would only get a " clear to fly " notice from the aviation doctors alerting the airline that a pilot has completed recertification*****0
@entity10 had visited an eye doctor because of vision problems , a @entity70 government official familiar with the investigation told @entity8*****0
the pilot complained he was not seeing as he should , but the doctor told him the cause was psychosomatic , the official said*****0
in part because of this , the doctor deemed @entity10 unfit for flying*****0
@entity10 told a different doctor -- a neuropsychologist -- that he was too stressed with work , the @entity70 official said*****0
the dates of these visits are unclear , but they could have been earlier this year*****0
the official said he is not aware of any suicidal tendencies reported by @entity10 to the doctors , but that investigators believe he was suicidal*****0
airline officials have said that if @entity10 went to a doctor on his own , he would have been required to self - report if deemed unfit to fly*****0
a @entity3 clinic said he 'd gone there twice , most recently on march 10 , " concerning a diagnosis*****0
" but the @entity109 said it had not treated @entity10 for depression*****0
the speculation about @entity10 ' mental state is based on a letter found in a waste bin in his @entity3 apartment*****0
the note , which was " slashed , " said @entity10 was not able to do his job , @entity15 said friday*****0
@entity119 's most senior psychiatrist , sir @entity118 , told @entity8 's @entity120 on monday that when a pilot is " acutely depressed or suffering from really any physical illness " that impairs abilities , they can not fly an aircraft safely*****1
" we do n't let pilots fly with depression ... because they 're impaired in concentration , memory and attention , which is n't good for a pilot , " said @entity118 , who is president of the @entity125 and an adviser to the @entity119 army*****0
one of the strongest pieces of evidence to emerge from the crash so far comes from the cockpit voice recorder*****0
the sounds recorded on the recorder , known as a " black box , " firms up a theory by investigators that the co-pilot locked the captain out of the cockpit and then crashed the plane*****0
" for @entity149 's sake , open the door ! " capt. @entity151 screamed as he banged on the cockpit door , pleading with the co-pilot*****0
thirteen minutes later , the plane slammed into the @entity35*****0
the audio from the plane 's cockpit voice recorder has not been released , but the @entity4 newspaper @entity157 published sunday what it claims is a summary of the transcript from the recording*****1
@entity8 can not independently verify the information , which @entity157 says is based on 1.5 hours of audio that was on the cockpit voice recorder*****0
according to @entity157 's report , @entity151 told co-pilot @entity10 that he did n't manage to go to the bathroom before takeoff*****1
@entity10 told him he could go anytime*****0
after reaching cruising altitude , @entity151 asked @entity10 to prepare the landing*****0
once that 's finished , @entity10 again told the captain he " can go anytime*****1
" there is the sound of a seat being pushed backward after which the captain says , " you can take over*****0
" at 10:29 a.m. , air traffic radar detects that the plane is starting to descend*****0
three minutes later , air traffic controllers try to contact the plane and receive no answer -- shortly after which an alarm goes off in the cockpit , warning of the " sink rate , " @entity157 reported*****0
next comes the banging*****0
@entity151 begs @entity10 to let him in*****0
passengers then begin to scream , according to the transcript obtained by @entity157*****0
another three minutes pass*****0
a loud metallic bang is heard at 7,000 meters ( almost 23,000 feet )*****0
a minute and half later and 2,000 meters ( about 6,500 feet ) lower to the ground , an alarm says , " terrain -- pull up ! " " open the damn door ! " the pilot says*****0
it 's 10:38 a.m. , and the plane is at 4,000 meters ( about 13,000 feet )*****0
@entity10 's breathing can still be heard on the voice recorder , according to @entity157 's report*****1
two minutes later , investigators think they hear the plane 's right wing scrape a mountaintop*****0
screams can be heard one final time*****0
@entity45 's accident investigation agency , @entity212 , told @entity8 that the agency was " dismayed " by the voice recording leak to @entity157*****1
@entity215 , a spokeswoman for the agency , said the leak could not have come from a @entity212 agent*****0
she said the agency considers the report mere " voyeurism*****0
" cockpit recordings are some of the most sensitive and closely held parts of aviation crash investigations*****0
they 're never officially released , according to @entity8 aviation reporter @entity226*****0
@entity227 called it " unbelievable " that the black box audio would be leaked in this manner*****0
communications between air traffic control and a plane 's cockpit can be downloaded privately , but that 's less common in @entity70 than it is in the @entity236*****1
an edited and redacted version of the transcript is usually published in part of a final report on an incident*****0
although search teams have recovered the cockpit voice recorder , the flight data recorder remains missing*****0
that device could reveal crucial details about what happened during the final moments of the flight*****1
about 150 @entity4 investigators -- some specializing in homicide cases and others in identifying remains -- are in the @entity35 at the site of the crash , @entity3 police said monday*****1
meanwhile , police continue to examine evidence collected from the apartment of @entity10 and from his parents ' home , police said*****0
@entity35 investigators at the crash site said they are optimistic they will be able to identify most of the passengers but added that " it may not be possible to find the human remains of all the 150 passengers , as some of them may have been pulverized by the crash*****1
" of the 150 passengers , 78 had been identified through dna , lt. col. @entity269 told @entity8*****0
weather conditions slowed the rescue work monday , capt. @entity271 of the @entity273 unit said*****0
a new path under construction to the crash site will reduce the time it takes to reach the area , he said*****1
@entity282 mayor @entity281 told @entity8 the path was within 100 meters of being finished*****1
he commissioned a backhoe to build the path , he said*****0
" i felt the family members wanted this and they asked me to get them as close as possible , as if every meter mattered to them , " he said*****0
the path will allow all - terrain vehicles to reach the site with fewer risks than with helicopter transfers*****0
family members of those aboard @entity293 , meanwhile , are making the grim pilgrimage to the crash site*****1
a total of 325 people have so far traveled to the site , @entity58 chief operating officer @entity296 said monday at a news conference*****0
he detailed what the airline is doing to support relatives of the victims*****0
