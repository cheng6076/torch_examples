a video of @entity9 yanking young @entity10 from a group of protesters -- and subsequently pummeling him with her fists and a few slaps upside the head -- went viral*****0
many called her a hero : a mother determined to stop the cycle of violence*****0
and yet , was n't she also promoting violence ? her own reaction , after all , was to yell , curse and hit*****0
" why is @entity28 celebrating the beating of a black child ? " asked a writer at the @entity27*****0
is n't violence at home what leads to violence outside the home ? is n't this why rioting happens ? i 'm not excusing violence in any form*****0
i wish it did n't exist*****0
but @entity3 is n't on fire because of mothers like @entity9*****0
in fact , what we need , not only in communities like @entity3 but also in communities around the country , are more mothers like her*****0
mothers who will do whatever it takes to protect their children and steer them through the increasingly tricky course of adolescence*****0
i do n't see @entity9 as an abusive mother spreading the gospel , or at least the inevitability , of violence*****0
i do n't see her as a hero , either*****0
what i do see in @entity9 is a woman who is just like millions of other mothers of adolescents , mothers whose daily struggle is focused on guiding their kids in a positive direction while also helping them develop their own identities and independence*****0
mothers who know the anger and frustration that can result when they catch their teenager in a lie*****0
as @entity9 told @entity81 , she 'd told @entity10 the night before not to join in any riots*****0
he swore he would n't*****0
but her momma bear sense kicked in , and when she heard that school was closing early , she did n't take the chance that he 'd stick to his promise*****0
she went to the site of the riots to make sure that she could help him stay the course*****0
she went there so that she could help him keep his promise*****0
and when she got there and saw he had n't , as she suspected , she reacted in the way that she knew would , in that moment , be most effective to get him out of there*****0
and that 's the key here*****0
it 's easy to punish a teenager for acting out , just as it 's easy to punish @entity9 for taking out her frustrations on @entity10 in a physical way*****0
but @entity9 's actions are evidence of her commitment as a parent*****0
for better or worse , she knows her son*****0
and she knows her community , and her reality*****0
she knows that she 's the mother of an adolescent boy living in a city caught up in a very heated , violent moment*****1
and she will do anything to protect her son , including put herself in a dangerous situation to pull him out of there*****0
can we all say that ? @entity2 raises an important point that 's often missing in the discussions of how to curb violence : moms have power*****1
the world needs more momma bear types -- mothers who might be willing to put themselves between their child and certain danger*****0
mothers who are willing to defy the " expert " advice telling them that teenagers need the room to make mistakes ; that hovering or even trying to anticipate their misbehavior only stunts their development and leads to more misbehavior*****0
now more than ever , there are exceptions to that rule*****0
those of us who live in communities that are generally safe ca n't imagine the level of fear and frustration that must run through the very core of a mother like @entity9*****0
we do n't all face the same obstacles as the people who live in places like @entity3*****0
but we all face the same challenges in raising children*****0
perhaps it 's time to recognize that , at least in that sense , we 're more alike than we are different .*****0
