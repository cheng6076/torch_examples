) the risk for both diseases goes up for everyone after age 60 , with some people , especially @entity66 , at higher risk in their 40s*****1
that 's why the @entity70 of @entity71 recommends getting a baseline eye exam when you turn the big 4 - 0 , even if you have perfect vision*****1
in the early stages , you can have either condition , but have no symptoms at all*****0
things like a family history or high blood pressure , or issues within the eye ( like having a thinner cornea , for example ) might lead your @entity40 to prescribe drops that can reduce your chances of developing glaucoma by about half*****1
related : 10 natural ways to lower blood pressure there is no cure for either disease*****0
but like those eyedrops , there are treatments that may delay the progression of early - stage glaucoma ( from other drugs to surgery ) , and therapies that might halt further vision loss in advanced cases of macular degeneration ( including an implantable telescope )*****1
the future looks brighter however : an animal study published this month suggests that an injection of stem cells into the eye might slow or even reverse the effects of early - stage macular degeneration*****1
there are also simple things you can start doing right now to ward off these diseases*****0
here , five ways to protect your peepers*****0
slip on your shades — even when it 's cloudy @entity122 exposure can up the risk for glaucoma and macular degeneration , as well as cataracts ( clouding of the lenses )*****1
make sure your sunglasses offer 99 % to 100 % uv protection*****0
sporting a pair that does n't filter uv light is more dangerous than wearing no shades at all , because the dark lenses cause your pupils to dilate and allow in more harmful rays*****0
schedule in a regular walk studies indicate that aerobic exercise can reduce the eye pressure that leads to glaucoma , and may improve blood flow to the retina and optic nerve*****1
according to the @entity146 , all you need to do is raise your pulse 20 % to 25 % ( which could mean a brisk walk ) for 20 minutes , a minimum of four times a week*****0

another good source : egg yolks*****0
snack on almonds , citrus , and berries almonds are loaded with vitamin e ( a handful provides about half your daily dose ) , which slows macular degeneration ; while citrus fruit and berries are filled with vitamin c , which cuts your odds of developing the disease*****1
avoid cigarette smoke while smoking is bad news for many parts of your body , you may not have considered eyes to be one of them*****0
however , smoking doubles your risk of macular degeneration*****1
avoiding cigs can not only protect your lungs and heart , it can protect your peepers too .*****0
