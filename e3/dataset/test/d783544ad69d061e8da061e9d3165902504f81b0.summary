@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) @entity1 deputy president @entity3 on saturday gave the @entity5 ' refugee agency three months to relocate refugees from the @entity8 camp -- the world 's largest -- to @entity10 , or " we shall relocate them ourselves*****1
" " the way @entity16 changed after 9/11 is the way @entity1 will change after @entity17 , " @entity3 said in @entity12 , according to a statement from his office*****1
@entity19 gunmen stormed @entity20 in eastern @entity1 this month , killing 147 people*****1
@entity1 's government says that attack was masterminded by senior @entity19 leader @entity24 , whose " extensive terrorist network within @entity1 " extends into the sprawling @entity8 complex , according to a @entity1 government document given to @entity2*****1
students wake to @entity32 militants ' terror @entity3 , who is the second highest - ranking person in @entity1 's government behind president @entity34 , said his government has had discussions with @entity5 officials about what to do with the camp*****1
on saturday , a @entity5 @entity41 officer said the agency had not received any formal request from @entity1 's government about moving @entity8*****1
the @entity5 refugee agency manages the @entity8 complex , having set up the first camps there in late 1991 amid @entity10 's civil war*****1
the agency and the governments of both @entity1 and @entity10 agreed in 2013 on a process for the repatriation of @entity10 refugees*****0
but that was supposed to be mutually agreed - upon and voluntary , in accordance with the refugees ' " freely expressed wish and their relevant knowledge of the conditions " where they 'd end up , according to the pact*****0
none of those things , it seems , applies now to the move pushed by @entity3 on saturday*****0
it 's not clear where he expects the refugees to go , other than somewhere into @entity10 and out of @entity1*****1
any mass move would be a monumental task , disrupting the already difficult lives of more than 600,000 @entity10 who call the camp their home*****1
simply meeting basic needs is a challenge in the vast complex , which has seen devastating droughts , contagious diseases and other travails that have tested its residents and those trying to help*****0
still , as tough as conditions there are , they are seen as a better alternative to life back in @entity10 , where @entity19 is based and has carried out violent attacks for years*****0
yet the @entity32 extremist group has n't confined its terror to its homeland , as illustrated by the @entity17 attack and the 2013 siege of @entity0 's upscale @entity95 , which ended with at least 67 dead*****0
the @entity8 complex came under government scrutiny after the @entity95 attack , too*****0
but just a few weeks later , @entity2 's @entity99 managed to go from @entity10 to the @entity8 refugee camp undetected by taking one of the panya , or " rat routes , " just like many others have done , @entity19 sympathizers among them*****1
such illicit travel along porous borders as well as police officers ' willful ignorance of migrants ' fake ids , as acknowledged by then - interior minister @entity113 , illustrates @entity1 's challenge in keeping out threats from @entity10*****1
that 's why , in addition to moving the @entity8 camp , @entity1 is building of a 435 - mile ( 700 - kilometer ) wall covering most of the @entity10 border from @entity121 to @entity122 -- a wall that @entity3 says has begun to prevent @entity19 elements from getting into @entity1*****1
the deputy president also vowed that any businesses collaborating with the militant group will be shut down*****1
these measures are in addition to @entity1 airstrikes on @entity19 camps in @entity10 in the days after the @entity17 massacre*****0
" we must secure this country at whatever cost , even if we lose business with @entity10 , " @entity3 said saturday*****1
" no politics , no games , no half - measures should apply , as the death of the 147 students must touch all @entity1*****0
" @entity2 's @entity141 reported from @entity0 , and @entity2 's @entity142 reported and wrote this story from @entity144 .*****0
