( @entity1 ) a freshly fallen tree in the roadway was @entity4 's first clue . @entity4 was driving through a canyon in @entity6 , @entity7 , on wednesday when he saw the tree , then looked up to see an suv dangling over the edge of a cliff . the only thing holding the @entity12 and its terrified driver from a 30 - foot drop was a crumpled chain - link fence , still clinging to the earth above @entity17 . " i seen that guy hanging there and he was trying to beat the window out or the door open and i was like ' oh man , ' ' cause only like five links were hanging there , " @entity4 told @entity18 , a @entity1 affiliate . " i was like , i got ta do something and no one was doing anything . " what @entity4 did next , captured in a dramatic photo by @entity33 photographer @entity32 , made headlines around the world . @entity4 dashed from his car and scrambled up a hill to the @entity12 and its driver , 23 - year - old @entity38 , who appeared to be in shock . " i got up there and i was like , ' are you alright man ? ' he shook his head , yeah . i grabbed my snap - on multi-tool and it had jagged edges on each end . i hit the window three times and it did n't break . every time i hit it , the thing rocked like it was going to fall off , " @entity4 told @entity18 . @entity38 was finally able to get the passenger - side window down . @entity4 then reached in and pulled @entity38 out to safety -- a moment recorded by @entity32 's camera . then @entity4 disappeared . " i left and got out of there before anyone knew who i was , " he said . he remained an unknown good samaritan , his identity a mystery , until @entity32 's picture of the daring rescue appeared in the @entity6 paper and spread across the @entity65 . " i do n't feel like i deserve any credit or anything , " @entity4 said . " i just did what anyone would do , went right back to work . " thanks to @entity4 , @entity38 went to the hospital with just minor injuries . " the @entity75 would like to thank @entity4 for his quick and decisive actions in helping mr. @entity38 and preventing the situation from worsening , " said @entity74 , the interim police chief . @entity4 told @entity18 he did n't want or expect all the attention and would rather be fishing in the mountains than reading about himself .
