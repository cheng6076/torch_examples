@entity0 ( @entity1 ) judge @entity2 does n't have a lot of company on the appeals courts these days . @entity6 , who sits on the 6th @entity8 @entity7 in @entity9 , penned the only recent appellate court decision to uphold state bans on same - sex marriage . his opinion , issued in november , goes up against an avalanche of judicial rulings striking down such bans . the split helped pave the way for the @entity8 @entity20 to take up a case on tuesday that could ultimately decide whether gay and lesbian couples nationwide have a constitutional right to marry . and it provides important insight into the legal arguments that could be made before the court by states seeking to uphold bans at a time when the national sentiment is quickly shifting in favor of same - sex marriage . " it 's an ideal piece of judicial craftsmanship , " said @entity34 of the @entity35 , who believes that state bans on same - sex marriage are constitutional . @entity6 " more or less takes each and every argument that the other side has made , and then one by one by one , he explains why it does n't work . " critics call the opinion an outlier and do n't believe it will carry much weight , considering the number of courts that have overturned same - sex marriage bans in the nearly two years since the @entity20 struck down the core of the federal @entity51 . " judge @entity6 's opinion stands alone , " said @entity52 , legal director of @entity53 , a gay rights advocacy group . @entity6 , 54 , is the former state solicitor for @entity55 , where he handled appeals for the state 's attorney general . he clerked for justices @entity62 and @entity63 -- @entity62 once called @entity6 " one of the very best law clerks i ever had . " appointed to the bench by president @entity66 , @entity6 is considered a conservative jurist with a keen interest in states ' rights . here are the central arguments from his opinion that states seeking to uphold their same - sex marriage bans are expected to echo on tuesday . it is " dangerous and demeaning , " @entity6 wrote , to the citizenry to assume that only judges " can fairly understand " the arguments for and against same - sex marriage . " is n't the goal to create a culture in which a majority of citizens dignify and respect the rights of minority groups ? " he asked in the opinion joined by judge @entity82 , also a @entity66 appointee . critics such as @entity52 have roundly condemned such reasoning . " the people do n't get to decide what the @entity94 safeguards , " @entity52 said . " they do n't get to vote to violate the @entity94 . " @entity6 pointed to the drafters and their views of the 14th amendment . " nobody in this case , " he wrote , " argues that the people who adopted the @entity100 understood it to require the @entity102 to change the definition of marriage . " it 's an argument made to enforce the idea that there is no fundamental right to marriage for same - sex couples in the @entity94 . " from the founding of the @entity120 to 2003 , every state defined marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman , " he wrote , noting that the " @entity100 permits , though does not require , @entity102 to define marriage that way . " he said that the same - sex marriage bans rationally advance a legitimate government policy . " by creating a status ( marriage ) and by subsidizing it ( e.g. with tax - filing privileges and deductions ) , the @entity102 created an incentive for two people who procreate together to stay together for purposes of rearing offspring . " he said that states should not be accused of " irrationality , " but only the awareness that same - sex couples do n't have children in the same way as couples of the opposite sex . @entity6 pushes back on any suggestion that those who oppose same - sex marriage have negative feelings about gay and lesbian couples . he said that ballot initiatives banning same sex - marriage were not driven by hostility but were passed by " real people who teach our children , create our jobs , and defend our shores . " @entity158 , a @entity0 appellate lawyer who help to defend @entity160 's ban on same - sex marriage , calls @entity6 's opinion a road map for whoever might write an opinion supporting state bans . " he 's very much willing both in the result and in his analysis to leave the issue to the people without suggesting an answer one way or another , " @entity158 said . but attached to @entity6 's opinion was a harsh dissent from a third member of the three - judge panel that heard the case in the @entity179 . judge @entity180 , a @entity181 appointee , dismissed the opinion as an " engrossing @entity184 talk " and a " largely irrelevant discourse on democracy and federalism . " @entity180 said that @entity6 failed to see the plaintiffs as individuals " suffering actual harm . " " these plaintiffs are not political zealots trying to push reform on their fellow citizens , " she wrote , but committed same - sex couples seeking equal status . her harshest language was for @entity6 's premise that the decision should be left to the democratic process . " if we in the judiciary do not have the authority , and indeed the responsibility , to right fundamental wrongs left excused by a majority of the electorate , our whole intricate , constitutional system of checks and balances , as well as the oaths to which we swore , prove to be nothing but shams .
