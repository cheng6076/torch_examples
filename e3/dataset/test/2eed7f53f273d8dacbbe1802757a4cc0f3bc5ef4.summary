( @entity2 ) @entity1 watchers in western @entity3 are in for a treat : a nearly five - minute total lunar eclipse this morning . here 's how it 's unfolding : it started at 3:16 a.m. @entity8 , when the moon began moving into @entity11 's shadow . for the next hour and 45 minutes , that shadow will move across the moon and engulf it at 4:58 a.m. @entity8 . the total eclipse will only last four minutes and 43 seconds , and @entity15 says that makes it the shortest one of the century . watch it live on @entity19 while people west of the @entity22 will have the best view , at least a partial eclipse will be visible across the nation . but sunrise will interrupt the show on the @entity27 . parts of @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 also will be able to see the eclipse , but it wo n't be visible in @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 or the @entity39 . a lunar eclipse happens when the sun , @entity11 and moon form a straight line in space , with the @entity11 smack in the middle . the sun shines on the @entity11 and creates a shadow . as the moon moves deeper into that shadow , it appears to turn dark and may even appear to be a reddish color . why red ? because @entity11 's atmosphere is filtering out most of the blue light . some people have nicknamed the effect the " blood moon . " @entity15 says lunar eclipses typically happen at least twice a year , but this eclipse is the third in a series of four in a row , known as a " tetrad .
