( @entity1 ) criminal justice reform is rapidly becoming one of the few bipartisan issues of our time*****0
it 's about time*****0
@entity6 has the highest incarceration rate in the world , with 5 % of the world 's population and 25 % of its prisoners*****1
nearly 2½ million @entity13 are in prison*****0
over 65 million people , or 20 % of the country , have criminal records*****0
most disturbingly , nearly 40 % of our country 's prisoners are african - americans , who only make up 13 % of the general population*****1
it 's time for policymakers to address this criminal justice crisis head on*****0
we must change the dismal status quo*****1
we must start by asking a simple question : why are so many @entity13 criminals ? look no further than @entity29 , which has spent the past century devising the most complicated — and nonsensical — criminal code known to man*****0
the federal criminal code includes over 4,500 laws and counting , not to mention government regulations for which there are criminal penalties*****0
the list of federal crimes is so long , so broad and so vague that you and i likely commit three felonies every day , unwittingly breaking numerous federal laws as we go about our daily business*****0
no wonder @entity6 's prison population is out of control*****1
@entity13 are n't addicted to crime ; our politicians are addicted to criminalizing things*****0
sadly , the criminalization of @entity13 also traps them in poverty*****0
according to the @entity54 , incarceration leads to reduced wages ( 11 % drop ) , employment ( nine weeks lost annually ) , and earnings overall ( 40 % annually )*****1
making matters worse , over half of new prisoners are at or below the poverty line and three - quarters of former prisoners are sent back to jail within five years of their release*****0
the deck is stacked against my generation in particular*****0
young adults are 10 % of the population yet comprise 29 % of the country 's arrests*****1
@entity13 are particularly at risk : they 're 15 times more likely to be in prison than whites*****0
no wonder 18 - to - 29 - year - olds have the lowest level of trust of any age group that our justice system treats everyone equally*****0
thankfully , there is a bipartisan consensus in @entity29 that something needs to be done , and fast*****0
on the left , civil rights groups and their allies in @entity89 have been demanding that the criminal system be fixed for years*****0
on the right , politicians from @entity93 to @entity94 are now recommending the same thing*****0
if politicians are serious , they should consider three specific areas for reform*****0
1*****0
reduce punishment for nonviolent crimes politicians should consider reducing nonviolent offenses from felonies to misdemeanors , and end mandatory sentencing for nonviolent crimes*****0
the federal government 's unsuccessful war on drugs has led to unfair punishments for nonviolent drug offenders who made youthful mistakes*****0
while some policies may have made sense in the 1980s and ' 90s , they now do more harm than good*****0
those involved in the buying and selling of small amounts of drugs should n't be subjected to years or decades in prison for their crimes*****0
and more generally , judges should be free to tailor their rulings to the specific facts and details of the case -- and the person standing before them*****0
2*****0
rebuild respect between communities and police one - size - fits - all mandates and decrees from @entity29 -- from drug laws to civil asset forfeiture to no - knock warrants — create divisions between local law enforcement and the local communities they serve*****0
practices , policies and programs that create unnecessary distrust and unease should be eliminated*****0
it 's the same for police militarization , which has occurred in large part because @entity29 has supplied local agencies with weapons and tools that are inappropriate for use in local communities*****0
letting local communities set their own law enforcement policies will go a long way toward restoring the trust that right now seems almost nonexistent*****0
3*****0
give ex-nonviolent offenders a second chance too many reformed convicts return to jail because they face insurmountable barriers that keep them from living a normal life*****0
legislators can begin fixing this by encouraging greater record - sealing and expungement for youthful , non violent offenders , thereby giving people who made mistakes a greater chance of finding work and rejoining society*****0
reducing licensing barriers and restoring voting rights for those with criminal backgrounds should also be considered*****0
this list is only a starting point , yet our elected officials could — and should — quickly and easily take it up*****0
in our era of hyperpartisanship , we should focus on those few things on which @entity13 agree*****0
fixing our country 's broken criminal justice system should be at the top of the list .*****0
