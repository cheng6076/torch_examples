( @entity4 ) after more than nine years of traveling through the solar system , @entity2 's @entity1 spacecraft has sent back its first color image of @entity6 . the initial picture released on tuesday shows a couple of orange - tinged blobs : @entity6 and its largest moon , @entity11 . but the probe will soon be beaming back much sharper images and a wealth of other information about @entity6 's remote , unexplored corner of the solar system . " this is pure exploration ; we 're going to turn points of light into a planet and a system of moons before your eyes , " said @entity18 , @entity1 ' principal investigator . launched in 2006 , @entity1 is nearing the crucial point in its epic voyage of more than 3 billion miles . the probe is due to make its closest approach to @entity6 on july 14 . " in an unprecedented flyby this july , our knowledge of what the @entity6 system is really like will expand exponentially , and i have no doubt there will be exciting discoveries , " said @entity32 , an astronaut and associate administrator of the @entity34 . discovered in 1930 , @entity6 was once considered to be the smallest planet in the solar system . but scientists have since revised that view because of @entity6 's size and location , demoting it to the status of " dwarf planet " : a planet that 's too small to clear other objects out of its way . @entity6 is 1,400 miles wide , roughly half the width of the continental @entity55 . at 3.6 billion miles out in the solar system , it 's about 40 times as far from the sun as @entity59 is . by discovering more about @entity6 and its moons , @entity1 will shed light on a little - known third zone of the solar system , beyond the rocky planets and the gas giants . the area , known as the @entity67 , contains " mysterious small planets and planetary building blocks , " according to @entity2 . it 's known for producing comets , such as @entity72 , which orbits the sun about every 75 years . @entity1 will use its array of cameras and other instruments to study @entity6 's surface and atmosphere , as well as its moons , which number at least five . it will also be on the lookout for rings and other satellites . @entity18 said the spacecraft 's encounter was set to be " an exploration bonanza unparalleled in anticipation since the storied missions of @entity89 in the 1980s .

at 3.6 billion miles out in the solar system , it 's about 40 times as far from the sun as @entity59 is*****1
by discovering more about @entity6 and its moons , @entity1 will shed light on a little - known third zone of the solar system , beyond the rocky planets and the gas giants*****1
the area , known as the @entity67 , contains " mysterious small planets and planetary building blocks , " according to @entity2*****0
it 's known for producing comets , such as @entity72 , which orbits the sun about every 75 years*****0
@entity1 will use its array of cameras and other instruments to study @entity6 's surface and atmosphere , as well as its moons , which number at least five*****1
it will also be on the lookout for rings and other satellites*****0
