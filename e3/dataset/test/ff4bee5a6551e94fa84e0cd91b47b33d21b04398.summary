@entity1 , @entity2 ( @entity3 ) @entity0 did n't laugh once when he watched " @entity4 . " the @entity6 defector calls the @entity8 comedy " vulgar , " admitting he could n't even watch the whole film . yet he is still sending thousands of copies across the border from @entity2 to @entity6 in balloons , determined his people will see the movie in which the leader @entity15 is assassinated on screen . " the regime hates this film because it shows @entity15 as a man , not a @entity19 , " says @entity0 . " he cries and is afraid like us and then he 's assassinated . " @entity15 is portrayed in the movie as a @entity23 - loving , sensitive soul with daddy issues , clashing with the all - powerful image beamed out by @entity27 's tightly controlled state media and propaganda machine . at 1 a.m. , @entity0 makes a final check of the wind speed and direction , then heads towards the border with @entity6 . he has company . the @entity2 police and military drive closely behind . after @entity27 fired on similar propaganda balloons recently , they are monitoring launches very closely . this irritates @entity0 . " we can help towards reunification with these balloons , " says @entity0 . " it costs millions of dollars to buy a f - 22 fighter jet which the @entity2 government insist they need and that 's not for peaceful purposes . so why do civilians like me have to do this under cover of darkness ? " at 3 a.m. , @entity0 fills the balloons with helium and ties the bundles of dvds , dollar bills and political leaflets to the bottom . a timer is attached which will release the bundle once safely in @entity6 territory . he has no way of knowing what will happen to the goods after that . he does n't know if ordinary @entity6 will watch the movie and read the leaflets . the fact that @entity27 acts with fury against these so - called propaganda balloons suggests some information is seeping through to the hermit kingdom . " if you tell the truth in @entity6 , you die . but by using these balloons from here , i can tell the truth in safety , " @entity0 adds . the decision to launch the balloons in the dead of night is not just to avoid confrontation with @entity6 , but also with @entity2 's local residents . after @entity27 fired on balloons last october and @entity2 returned fire , those living close to the border have been trying to physically stop the launches , arguing they are being put in the line of fire . the chances of at least some @entity6 having watched the film that @entity6 sees as " an act of terrorism " is certainly possible .
