( @entity1 ) everybody loves a good comeback story -- especially one that 's dino - sized . after its name was booted from science books for more than a century , a new study suggests that the @entity6 belongs to its own genera , and therefore deserves its own name . @entity9 first named the @entity6 in 1879 , after he received 25 crates of bones discovered at @entity12 , @entity13 , according to the @entity14 . similar to , though not as large as the @entity6 discovered a couple of years prior , @entity9 named the dinosaur , " @entity6 , " or " thunder lizard . " @entity6 had three sacral vertebrae in its hip region and @entity6 had five , according to the museum 's website , so @entity9 gave the dinosaurs two different names . later it was discovered that the number of sacral vertebrae is related to age : as the animal gets older , two of the vertebrae fuse to the sacrum . paleontologist @entity32 concluded in 1903 that the @entity6 was really a young @entity6 , and therefore must go by that name , according to the museum . @entity35 , a paleontologist at the @entity36 , @entity37 , led this latest study , which took five years and included visits to 20 museums in @entity41 and the @entity42 to collect data . by examining " 500 anatomical traits , " @entity35 said he was able to " reconstruct the family tree " of @entity46 -- the family @entity6 and @entity6 belong to . @entity35 " looked at every single specimen , " according to @entity49 , curator of vertebrate paleontology at @entity14 and " noted their characteristics , " plugging data into an algorithm that revealed " five species in the group of @entity58 . " two of them are @entity6 - like and three are @entity6 - like , @entity49 said . while his findings have earned the excitement of @entity6 fans everywhere , @entity35 said he is " expecting a debate about the case of @entity6 . " " we think we have good evidence , " he said , " but i know there are other research groups that do not completely agree . " for @entity49 , @entity35 's discovery means changes are coming to the original @entity6 skeleton that has lived at the @entity14 since 1936 .
