( @entity1 ) the public outrage over the " religious freedom " bills recently passed in @entity3 and @entity4 caught the governors of those states completely off - guard , judging by their confused and contradictory responses . as poll watchers , they surely knew that most @entity10 now oppose the discriminatory laws and practices they accepted as normal only a dozen years ago . but the politicians underestimated the pushback organized by local and national businesses , including companies with no previous record of public support for social equality . they had better adjust to a new reality . for the past three decades , socially conservative evangelicals and pro-business interests have been powerfully allied against government regulations , environmental initiatives and social welfare programs , while supporting lower taxes for the wealthy and pushing back against the growing diversity in @entity10 's population . for many , this alliance been puzzling : other , equally devout @entity30 who place more emphasis on @entity33 's message of unconditional love and on his denunciations of excessive wealth and neglect of the poor , have been uncomfortable with it , as have many business leaders . their priorities , after all , are based on the bottom line . and companies that sell goods and services to the public are learning that support for discrimination -- or even passive acceptance of it -- threatens that bottom line . hence , after @entity4 gov. @entity54 signed a law that opened a new door for discrimination against same - sex couples , the threat of boycotts and other retaliation was swift , from groups as diverse as the @entity60 , the @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and even the @entity66 hotel chain . @entity66 was founded by @entity67 , a dedicated @entity68 , and is now run by his son @entity69 , also a @entity68 who fully accepts his church 's teachings about traditional marriage . yet in june , @entity66 launched a " @entity84 " marketing campaign , aimed at attracting lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender travelers with an assurance of " the company 's commitment to make everyone feel comfortable about who they are .

" in 2014 , global spending by @entity102 travelers was estimated at more than $ 200 billion , and spending by this market segment is rising much faster than overall spending on travel . so @entity67 worries when states start to make such travelers feel unwelcome . businesses seeking to develop brand loyalty among younger consumers have a special incentive to highlight their rejection of anti-gay bias . a @entity1 poll taken in february found that 72 % of millennials nationwide believe that same - sex couples have the right to have their marriages recognized as valid . even among white evangelical protestants , 43 % of millennials support same - sex marriage , compared with less than 20 % of those their grandparents ' age , 68 and older . it used to be that businesses could close their eyes to discrimination in areas geographically isolated from the more liberal coasts , but that is no longer possible . according to researchers for @entity134 's " look different " anti-bias campaign , 90 % of youths aged 14 to 24 agree that it is important to make their communities a less biased place , and almost 80 % say that everyone has a responsibility to help tackle bias . so who 's the " moral majority " now ? for media - savvy millennials , following that moral imperative means spreading the news about discrimination wherever it occurs and reaching beyond geographic boundaries to mobilize against it . in the first 24 hours after @entity3 passed its version of the " religious freedom " bill , the @entity153 hashtag # @entity151 was used 12,000 times . it then snowballed after celebrity blogger @entity159 tweeted it to his 5.9 million @entity153 followers . @entity10 has crossed a threshold where it is no longer a good business model or political strategy to be intolerant of diversity , whether that pertains to race , ethnicity , gender or sexual orientation . since 2011 , the majority of children that have been born in the @entity10 each year are members of racial or ethnic minorities . hispanics are projected to account for most of the growth in the labor force between now and 2060 . women now lead men in educational attainment . and more than half of @entity10 live in states where same - sex marriage is legal . business leaders and politicians who ignore or offend these constituencies do so at their own peril .

( @entity1 ) the public outrage over the " religious freedom " bills recently passed in @entity3 and @entity4 caught the governors of those states completely off - guard , judging by their confused and contradictory responses*****1
as poll watchers , they surely knew that most @entity10 now oppose the discriminatory laws and practices they accepted as normal only a dozen years ago*****0
but the politicians underestimated the pushback organized by local and national businesses , including companies with no previous record of public support for social equality*****0
they had better adjust to a new reality*****0
for the past three decades , socially conservative evangelicals and pro-business interests have been powerfully allied against government regulations , environmental initiatives and social welfare programs , while supporting lower taxes for the wealthy and pushing back against the growing diversity in @entity10 's population*****0
for many , this alliance been puzzling : other , equally devout @entity30 who place more emphasis on @entity33 's message of unconditional love and on his denunciations of excessive wealth and neglect of the poor , have been uncomfortable with it , as have many business leaders*****0
their priorities , after all , are based on the bottom line*****0
and companies that sell goods and services to the public are learning that support for discrimination -- or even passive acceptance of it -- threatens that bottom line*****0
hence , after @entity4 gov. @entity54 signed a law that opened a new door for discrimination against same - sex couples , the threat of boycotts and other retaliation was swift , from groups as diverse as the @entity60 , the @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and even the @entity66 hotel chain*****1
@entity66 was founded by @entity67 , a dedicated @entity68 , and is now run by his son @entity69 , also a @entity68 who fully accepts his church 's teachings about traditional marriage*****0
yet in june , @entity66 launched a " @entity84 " marketing campaign , aimed at attracting lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender travelers with an assurance of " the company 's commitment to make everyone feel comfortable about who they are*****0
" asked about the discrepancy between his religious rejection of same - sex marriage and his marketing overtures to same - sex honeymooners , @entity67 pointed to the @entity92 's injunction of unconditional love , but added " beyond that , i am very careful about separating my personal faith and beliefs from how we run our business*****1
" in 2014 , global spending by @entity102 travelers was estimated at more than $ 200 billion , and spending by this market segment is rising much faster than overall spending on travel*****0
so @entity67 worries when states start to make such travelers feel unwelcome*****0
businesses seeking to develop brand loyalty among younger consumers have a special incentive to highlight their rejection of anti-gay bias*****0
a @entity1 poll taken in february found that 72 % of millennials nationwide believe that same - sex couples have the right to have their marriages recognized as valid*****1
even among white evangelical protestants , 43 % of millennials support same - sex marriage , compared with less than 20 % of those their grandparents ' age , 68 and older*****1
it used to be that businesses could close their eyes to discrimination in areas geographically isolated from the more liberal coasts , but that is no longer possible*****0
according to researchers for @entity134 's " look different " anti-bias campaign , 90 % of youths aged 14 to 24 agree that it is important to make their communities a less biased place , and almost 80 % say that everyone has a responsibility to help tackle bias*****0
so who 's the " moral majority " now ? for media - savvy millennials , following that moral imperative means spreading the news about discrimination wherever it occurs and reaching beyond geographic boundaries to mobilize against it*****0
in the first 24 hours after @entity3 passed its version of the " religious freedom " bill , the @entity153 hashtag # @entity151 was used 12,000 times*****1
it then snowballed after celebrity blogger @entity159 tweeted it to his 5.9 million @entity153 followers*****0
@entity10 has crossed a threshold where it is no longer a good business model or political strategy to be intolerant of diversity , whether that pertains to race , ethnicity , gender or sexual orientation*****1
since 2011 , the majority of children that have been born in the @entity10 each year are members of racial or ethnic minorities*****0
hispanics are projected to account for most of the growth in the labor force between now and 2060*****0
women now lead men in educational attainment*****0
and more than half of @entity10 live in states where same - sex marriage is legal*****1
business leaders and politicians who ignore or offend these constituencies do so at their own peril .*****0
