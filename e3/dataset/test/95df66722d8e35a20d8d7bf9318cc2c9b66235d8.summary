( @entity3 ) the outlines of a nuclear deal with @entity2 are in place . unfortunately , it seems like too many in president @entity8 's administration have forgotten that the only reason this terrorist - supporting state came to the negotiating table in the first place was because of tough sanctions imposed by the @entity14 . indeed , the reality is that president @entity8 is giving up enormous leverage in his nuclear deal with @entity2 -- and i worry we will lose it for good . bleeding money , and faced with falling oil prices , supreme leader @entity23 gave his government rare permission to bargain with the " @entity27 " -- the @entity28 . but just as @entity28 and @entity30 sanctions were forcing @entity2 to the nuclear crossroads , president @entity8 has given @entity32 an easy exit . for @entity23 , the " framework " announced last week looks like a win - win : he gets to keep his nuclear infrastructure , and in return gets billions of dollars in sanctions relief . @entity14 offered a better strategy when the top @entity40 on the @entity41 , @entity42 , and i introduced a bill to hit @entity32 with its toughest sanctions yet . unfortunately , this bill -- which passed the @entity47 in a 400 - 20 vote -- was blocked in the @entity49 last year , despite the fact that it would have sharpened the @entity23 's choice : dismantle your nuclear weapons program or see your economy collapse . president @entity8 once had a tougher line , when in 2012 he said : " the deal we 'll accept is they end their nuclear program . it 's very straightforward . " but the framework announced last week does nothing of the sort . negotiated between @entity2 and the @entity28 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 , the framework concedes that @entity2 can maintain " a mutually defined enrichment program , " operate thousands of centrifuges , and continue its research and development of nuclear technologies . the deal currently on the table would hand @entity32 billions of previously sanctioned funds , filling the coffers of the world 's biggest state sponsor of terrorism , with strongholds in @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 . meanwhile , the strictest restrictions on @entity2 's enrichment will expire in only 10 years , despite the president receiving a letter from 367 @entity89 -- both @entity90 and @entity91 -- in which we insisted that " verifiable constraints on @entity2 's nuclear program must last for decades . " the president admitted as much when he conceded that " in year 13 , 14 , 15 , they have advanced centrifuges that enrich uranium fairly rapidly , and at that point the breakout times would have shrunk almost down to zero . " but as bad as these concessions are , the most concerning aspect of the april 2 deal is that it lacks tough safeguards to stop @entity2 from cheating . the key question is this : will the inspectors at the @entity106 be allowed to inspect these military sites without warning ? because if the @entity106 can not conduct " anytime , anywhere " inspections , @entity2 will be able to " sneak out " to a bomb . it has been done before . remember , in 1994 , when president @entity111 told us he had struck a deal with @entity114 that would " make the @entity28 , the @entity115 , and the world safer " ? president @entity111 sounded a little too much like the current secretary of state @entity118 , when he promised that the @entity114 agreement " does not rely on trust " and that " compliance will be certified by the @entity106 . " twelve years after these assurances , @entity114 detonated its first nuclear bomb . @entity2 could easily do the same . the best predictor of its future behavior is its past behavior -- between 2004 and 2009 , the @entity2 government built a huge centrifuge facility named @entity129 under a mountain deep in the @entity2 desert . luckily for the world , @entity133 intelligence agencies discovered @entity32 's deception . but we can not rely on such luck in the future , particularly when @entity2 still has n't come clean about its history of secret weapons development and is still dodging basic questions from the @entity106 . let 's not forget the other things @entity2 has been doing while its diplomats have been bargaining with the @entity28 and its partners . while @entity2 was showing its friendly new face to the world , it has simultaneously been helping @entity81 dictator @entity149 kill his own people , training and funding the terrorist group @entity152 , which aims to annihilate @entity153 , and supporting the @entity154 , who started a civil war and overthrew the government in @entity83 -- one of @entity28 's more reliable counterterrorism partners in the region . if president @entity8 is going to hand over billions of dollars to a regime that behaves like this , run by a man who publicly declares : " @entity165 , " it has to be a better deal . the framework we have before us keeps @entity2 's nuclear door well and truly open .

( @entity3 ) the outlines of a nuclear deal with @entity2 are in place*****1
unfortunately , it seems like too many in president @entity8 's administration have forgotten that the only reason this terrorist - supporting state came to the negotiating table in the first place was because of tough sanctions imposed by the @entity14*****0
indeed , the reality is that president @entity8 is giving up enormous leverage in his nuclear deal with @entity2 -- and i worry we will lose it for good*****1
bleeding money , and faced with falling oil prices , supreme leader @entity23 gave his government rare permission to bargain with the " @entity27 " -- the @entity28*****0
but just as @entity28 and @entity30 sanctions were forcing @entity2 to the nuclear crossroads , president @entity8 has given @entity32 an easy exit*****1
for @entity23 , the " framework " announced last week looks like a win - win : he gets to keep his nuclear infrastructure , and in return gets billions of dollars in sanctions relief*****1
@entity14 offered a better strategy when the top @entity40 on the @entity41 , @entity42 , and i introduced a bill to hit @entity32 with its toughest sanctions yet*****0
unfortunately , this bill -- which passed the @entity47 in a 400 - 20 vote -- was blocked in the @entity49 last year , despite the fact that it would have sharpened the @entity23 's choice : dismantle your nuclear weapons program or see your economy collapse*****1
president @entity8 once had a tougher line , when in 2012 he said : " the deal we 'll accept is they end their nuclear program*****0
it 's very straightforward*****0
" but the framework announced last week does nothing of the sort*****0
negotiated between @entity2 and the @entity28 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 , the framework concedes that @entity2 can maintain " a mutually defined enrichment program , " operate thousands of centrifuges , and continue its research and development of nuclear technologies*****1
the deal currently on the table would hand @entity32 billions of previously sanctioned funds , filling the coffers of the world 's biggest state sponsor of terrorism , with strongholds in @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84*****0
meanwhile , the strictest restrictions on @entity2 's enrichment will expire in only 10 years , despite the president receiving a letter from 367 @entity89 -- both @entity90 and @entity91 -- in which we insisted that " verifiable constraints on @entity2 's nuclear program must last for decades*****1

the key question is this : will the inspectors at the @entity106 be allowed to inspect these military sites without warning ? because if the @entity106 can not conduct " anytime , anywhere " inspections , @entity2 will be able to " sneak out " to a bomb*****0
it has been done before*****0
remember , in 1994 , when president @entity111 told us he had struck a deal with @entity114 that would " make the @entity28 , the @entity115 , and the world safer " ? president @entity111 sounded a little too much like the current secretary of state @entity118 , when he promised that the @entity114 agreement " does not rely on trust " and that " compliance will be certified by the @entity106*****0

@entity2 could easily do the same*****0
the best predictor of its future behavior is its past behavior -- between 2004 and 2009 , the @entity2 government built a huge centrifuge facility named @entity129 under a mountain deep in the @entity2 desert*****1
luckily for the world , @entity133 intelligence agencies discovered @entity32 's deception*****0
but we can not rely on such luck in the future , particularly when @entity2 still has n't come clean about its history of secret weapons development and is still dodging basic questions from the @entity106*****1
let 's not forget the other things @entity2 has been doing while its diplomats have been bargaining with the @entity28 and its partners*****1
while @entity2 was showing its friendly new face to the world , it has simultaneously been helping @entity81 dictator @entity149 kill his own people , training and funding the terrorist group @entity152 , which aims to annihilate @entity153 , and supporting the @entity154 , who started a civil war and overthrew the government in @entity83 -- one of @entity28 's more reliable counterterrorism partners in the region*****1
if president @entity8 is going to hand over billions of dollars to a regime that behaves like this , run by a man who publicly declares : " @entity165 , " it has to be a better deal*****0
