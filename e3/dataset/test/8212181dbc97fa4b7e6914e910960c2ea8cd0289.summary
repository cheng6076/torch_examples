( @entity0 ) the victory of a 72 - year - old former general , @entity2 , in the @entity4 elections represents a moment of maturity in @entity8 politics*****0
@entity2 , who some 30 years ago was @entity4 's harsh military leader , could of course prove to be a disaster ; so many self - described reformers have been*****1
swath but the peaceful transition of power from president @entity14 to president @entity2 is the first of its kind in history*****0
and the fact that the winner ran on an anti-corruption platform suggests that ordinary @entity4 have finally had enough of the venality of their elites*****0
for too long , @entity4 's poor have been victims of their country 's enormous wealth*****1
the cancer of corruption has to be cut out*****0
i visited @entity4 in january and found a country under siege*****0
@entity31 , the capital city , is where the rich have always imagined themselves making their last stand*****0
soldiers guard the treacherous motorways ; houses are compounds covered in barbed wire*****0
it 's a place where poor children rise at dawn to sift through the trash cans for food and black magic is practiced by the side of the road at dusk*****1
yet thanks to @entity4 's oil , there is also tremendous wealth in @entity31*****1
and when you do n't really make money but simply take it from the soil and sell it , a crude kind of crony capitalism develops in which who you know is far more important than what you know*****0
graft trickles down through the system ; through family , through patronage and through shady deals done with foreign businessmen at the 24 - hour party palace at the @entity71*****0
the richest buy off the anger of the poorest , and vast swaths of society become complicit in the crime*****0
for a while , that system brought some stability to the government of @entity14*****0
but stability was contingent upon oil remaining at $ 110 a barrel , and in recent months the price has collapsed to below $ 50 a barrel*****0
lacking funds , the government could no longer promise jobs to voters and had to start thinking creatively about serious economic development*****0
one was the massive privatization of the power system , a sensible idea that promised to take energy provision out of the hands of a broken state and give it to businessmen to run*****0
the problem is that costly investment and redevelopment did n't come soon enough : millions were left without power and the government 's few bold attempts at reform smacked of betrayal*****0
the problem of corruption went hand - in - glove with the rise of terrorism*****1
@entity4 is not a natural , comfortable nation state ; it 's composed of many ethnicities and two major competing religions*****1
the south is dominated by @entity116 like @entity14 , the north by @entity118 like @entity2*****0
and the north has witnessed a brutal , bloody terrorist insurgency led by @entity120 , which translates as " @entity122 education is forbidden*****0
" westerners might assume that @entity120 's major target is the @entity126 south but , in fact , its war is as much against nonfundamentalist @entity118 as it is non-muslims , and its attacks have generally been focused on @entity132 population centers*****1
failure to deal with this has not entirely been due to @entity120 's strategic ingenuity*****1
previous administrations have simply been too dysfunctional to fight a war on terror*****0
in 2010 , for instance , the government awarded a $ 470 million contract to provide security in @entity31*****0
few of the promised cameras were installed , yet the money was still paid in full*****0
and soldiers sent to the front report being poorly equipped*****0
the government is thought to have resorted to trying to purchase arms on the international black market , according to news reports -- although this is the kind of story that is hard to verify due to bans on granting visas to foreign journalists ( i was in @entity4 as a consultant on a business visa )*****0
what is directly observable is that while the government proved capable of providing security in some areas , in others it utterly failed*****0
and the @entity14 government might have benefited from the @entity120 terrorist emergency continuing in @entity118 centers , for the @entity118 were far more likely to vote for @entity2*****1
for @entity2 to win , he had to draw large numbers of votes in @entity126 areas -- and there , again , a @entity122 prejudice is challenged*****0
the victory of a @entity118 candidate in @entity4 does not represent the victory of @entity175 , as we have so often been told by those skeptical of the ability of the @entity118 world to govern itself*****0
on the contrary , @entity2 is associated with an earlier period in @entity4 history when the army was relatively well paid and respected*****0
he ran the country in the early 1980s along dictatorial lines , for sure*****0
but he also ran a @entity186 when in power in which civil servants who were late to work were ordered to do frog jumps , drug dealers were publicly executed , and some 474 politicians and business were arrested on charges of corruption*****0
@entity2 was removed in a coup , and he left office with the rare distinction of not having made very much money from it*****0
now he has won the presidency promising to tackle those intertwined problems of @entity120 and corruption*****1
get the army functioning properly again , @entity4 hope , and it will be able to drive back the fundamentalists*****0
@entity2 has his critics , many of whom charge him with misrepresenting his cv and being a closet authoritarian*****0
but they can not deny that he has won this historic victory because he has touched a chord with a people exhausted by years of misrule*****1
you can only bribe the voters for so long before the squalor becomes too much to bear .*****0
