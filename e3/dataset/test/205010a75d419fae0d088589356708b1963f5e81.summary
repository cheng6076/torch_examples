( @entity1 ) " sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; then come , follow me , " @entity0 tells the rich man in one of his best - known parables . it was a mantra he invoked repeatedly : the poor were blessed , and it was easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it was for the well - to - do to enter paradise . meanwhile , @entity0 told his @entity17 to leave their day jobs and follow him on an itinerant mission with few prospects of success and no visible means of support . so how did this wandering band of first - century evangelists support themselves ? clearly , money was a concern , and not just as an impediment to salvation . in the @entity31 , money gets 37 mentions , while " gold " gets 38 citations , " silver " merits 20 , and " copper " four . " @entity44 " comes up eight times , and " purse " and " denarii " -- the roman currency -- get half a dozen mentions each for a total of 119 currency referrals . perhaps the most relevant reference is also one of the most charged passages in the @entity31 : as the @entity49 tells it , six days before @entity48 , @entity0 was in @entity51 at the house of his friend @entity53 , whom he had raised from the dead . a woman named @entity55 takes a jar of costly perfumed oil and anoints the feet of the reclining @entity0 . she dries his feet with her hair , an irresistible image for artists and dramatists . @entity65 objected to the act . " why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor ? " @entity65 asks . though 300 denarii was the annual wage of a laborer , @entity0 told @entity65 to leave her alone , and foreshadowing his fate , said the anointing would be useful for his burial , and besides , " you always have the poor with you " -- but @entity0 would not always be there . what that passage makes clear is that the @entity0 community had a common purse because they needed money to survive . so how much ? " i imagine the ministry functioned at a subsistence level , " rabbi @entity88 , a professor of @entity89 and the @entity90 at @entity91 in @entity92 . @entity0 and his disciples walked , wore what they had , slept outside or in stayed in friends ' homes . they ate what they caught or what others shared . " i venture to guess that begging and hospitality will have sufficed to meet the basic needs of @entity0 and the companions with whom he traveled , " @entity88 said . @entity88 said that it was possible , even likely , that @entity0 and his followers received donations from supporters , and possibly substantial ones from some of the rich people who were drawn to his ministry despite -- or perhaps because of -- his preaching on the perils of wealth . the @entity116 gives us a glimpse of how @entity0 ' ministry functioned on a practical level : " soon afterwards he went on through cities and villages , proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of @entity125 . the twelve were with him , as well as some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities : @entity55 , called @entity130 , from whom seven demons had gone out , and @entity132 , the wife of @entity135 's steward @entity134 , and @entity136 , and many others , who provided for them out of their resources . " so , according to @entity116 , women whom @entity0 had healed in turn provided for him out of their " resources , " with @entity130 and @entity132 capturing our attention -- one by virtue of her husband , and the other , by her stature in the story of @entity0 . @entity132 was an upper - class woman married to a man who was intelligent and capable enough to manage the complicated household of @entity153 , the son of @entity153 , the violent and ambitious head of @entity150 . as part of this volatile but powerful household , @entity132 would be uniquely positioned to help @entity0 with her resources , being both wealthy and having palace connections . she attends to him during his life , and , the @entity159 tell us , after his death , as one of the trio of women who go to his tomb and find it empty . with her on that morning is @entity130 , also identified as -- among other things -- a financial supporter of @entity0 . @entity55 likely came from the prosperous town of @entity169 , on the @entity170 . as home to a thriving fishing industry , as well as dye and textile works , @entity55 could well have come from an affluent family -- or have been a successful business woman herself . @entity130 was free to travel the country with @entity0 and his disciples , so was unlikely to have a husband and children waiting for her at home , and in " @entity183 " we examine the @entity185 gospel of @entity130 and explore the argument that @entity0 was , in fact , her husband . she may have simply been an independent woman with her own resources who found a compelling message , and messenger . not only was @entity130 one of @entity0 ' most devoted followers , who stuck with him all the way from @entity194 to @entity195 , from the ministry to the cross and the tomb , but also she provided for him from her own means , said @entity200 , a professor of @entity31 and @entity201 at @entity202 . when the @entity159 speak of her " ministering " to @entity0 , they are explaining that she was one of the key figures in @entity0 ' everyday mission , @entity200 continues . along with other women like @entity132 and @entity136 , she was one of those who made his mission viable . along with these women , men like @entity210 and @entity211 , both men of stature and wealth , may have chipped in to help fund @entity0 ' ministry . the @entity159 reveal that both these men were rich , and supported @entity0 -- indeed , it was @entity210 who removed @entity0 from the cross on @entity220 , anointing his body with the help of @entity211 , and placing him in the tomb that @entity210 had reserved for himself . after the resurrection on that first @entity226 , the movement @entity0 started grew exponentially , and the church 's relationship to money grew more complicated as the needs became greater . @entity231 is co-author , with @entity232 , of " finding @entity0 : @entity233 . fact . @entity235 . : six holy objects that tell the @entity237 of the @entity159 . "

( @entity1 ) " sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; then come , follow me , " @entity0 tells the rich man in one of his best - known parables*****0
it was a mantra he invoked repeatedly : the poor were blessed , and it was easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it was for the well - to - do to enter paradise*****0
meanwhile , @entity0 told his @entity17 to leave their day jobs and follow him on an itinerant mission with few prospects of success and no visible means of support*****0
so how did this wandering band of first - century evangelists support themselves ? clearly , money was a concern , and not just as an impediment to salvation*****0
in the @entity31 , money gets 37 mentions , while " gold " gets 38 citations , " silver " merits 20 , and " copper " four*****0
" @entity44 " comes up eight times , and " purse " and " denarii " -- the roman currency -- get half a dozen mentions each for a total of 119 currency referrals*****0
perhaps the most relevant reference is also one of the most charged passages in the @entity31 : as the @entity49 tells it , six days before @entity48 , @entity0 was in @entity51 at the house of his friend @entity53 , whom he had raised from the dead*****0
a woman named @entity55 takes a jar of costly perfumed oil and anoints the feet of the reclining @entity0*****0
she dries his feet with her hair , an irresistible image for artists and dramatists*****0
@entity65 objected to the act*****0
" why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor ? " @entity65 asks*****0
though 300 denarii was the annual wage of a laborer , @entity0 told @entity65 to leave her alone , and foreshadowing his fate , said the anointing would be useful for his burial , and besides , " you always have the poor with you " -- but @entity0 would not always be there*****0
what that passage makes clear is that the @entity0 community had a common purse because they needed money to survive*****0
so how much ? " i imagine the ministry functioned at a subsistence level , " rabbi @entity88 , a professor of @entity89 and the @entity90 at @entity91 in @entity92*****0
@entity0 and his disciples walked , wore what they had , slept outside or in stayed in friends ' homes*****0
they ate what they caught or what others shared*****0
" i venture to guess that begging and hospitality will have sufficed to meet the basic needs of @entity0 and the companions with whom he traveled , " @entity88 said*****0
@entity88 said that it was possible , even likely , that @entity0 and his followers received donations from supporters , and possibly substantial ones from some of the rich people who were drawn to his ministry despite -- or perhaps because of -- his preaching on the perils of wealth*****1
the @entity116 gives us a glimpse of how @entity0 ' ministry functioned on a practical level : " soon afterwards he went on through cities and villages , proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of @entity125*****1
the twelve were with him , as well as some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities : @entity55 , called @entity130 , from whom seven demons had gone out , and @entity132 , the wife of @entity135 's steward @entity134 , and @entity136 , and many others , who provided for them out of their resources*****0
" so , according to @entity116 , women whom @entity0 had healed in turn provided for him out of their " resources , " with @entity130 and @entity132 capturing our attention -- one by virtue of her husband , and the other , by her stature in the story of @entity0*****1
@entity132 was an upper - class woman married to a man who was intelligent and capable enough to manage the complicated household of @entity153 , the son of @entity153 , the violent and ambitious head of @entity150*****0
as part of this volatile but powerful household , @entity132 would be uniquely positioned to help @entity0 with her resources , being both wealthy and having palace connections*****0
she attends to him during his life , and , the @entity159 tell us , after his death , as one of the trio of women who go to his tomb and find it empty*****0
with her on that morning is @entity130 , also identified as -- among other things -- a financial supporter of @entity0*****1
@entity55 likely came from the prosperous town of @entity169 , on the @entity170*****0
as home to a thriving fishing industry , as well as dye and textile works , @entity55 could well have come from an affluent family -- or have been a successful business woman herself*****0
@entity130 was free to travel the country with @entity0 and his disciples , so was unlikely to have a husband and children waiting for her at home , and in " @entity183 " we examine the @entity185 gospel of @entity130 and explore the argument that @entity0 was , in fact , her husband*****0
she may have simply been an independent woman with her own resources who found a compelling message , and messenger*****0
not only was @entity130 one of @entity0 ' most devoted followers , who stuck with him all the way from @entity194 to @entity195 , from the ministry to the cross and the tomb , but also she provided for him from her own means , said @entity200 , a professor of @entity31 and @entity201 at @entity202*****1
when the @entity159 speak of her " ministering " to @entity0 , they are explaining that she was one of the key figures in @entity0 ' everyday mission , @entity200 continues*****0
along with other women like @entity132 and @entity136 , she was one of those who made his mission viable*****0
along with these women , men like @entity210 and @entity211 , both men of stature and wealth , may have chipped in to help fund @entity0 ' ministry*****1
the @entity159 reveal that both these men were rich , and supported @entity0 -- indeed , it was @entity210 who removed @entity0 from the cross on @entity220 , anointing his body with the help of @entity211 , and placing him in the tomb that @entity210 had reserved for himself*****1
after the resurrection on that first @entity226 , the movement @entity0 started grew exponentially , and the church 's relationship to money grew more complicated as the needs became greater*****0
@entity231 is co-author , with @entity232 , of " finding @entity0 : @entity233*****0
