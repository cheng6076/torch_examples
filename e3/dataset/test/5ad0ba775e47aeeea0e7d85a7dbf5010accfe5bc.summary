the latest report shows that he sped up the descent of the plane to its doom*****0
it 's terrifying*****0
as the investigation unfolds , we will learn more about to what extent @entity3 kept his mental illness secret , or how much help he sought*****1
how much did his battle with depression affect his fitness to fly ? should he have walked away from his job ? should his doctors have sounded alarm bells ? his case raises larger and important issues about people who are burdened with mental illness and the pressure of its stigma*****1
too often and for too long , people with mental illness have been regarded by others around them as disasters waiting to happen*****1
when we do n't distinguish between people with a mental illness who are dangerous to society and those who are a danger to no one , we reinforce a pernicious idea that 's both bad for society and bad for those with mental illness*****1
some people feel a need to keep their mental illness a secret while others decline to seek help*****1
that 's why in our public and more private discourse , people with mental illness and the rest of society must talk about mental illness in a way that does n't drive some into the darkness*****1
we need to understand this malady as an illness and not a personal failing*****0
and we have to recognize that " mental illness " is a broad category encompassing many different challenges that affect people in a variety of ways*****1
people with mental illness are no more violent than the rest of the population and with proper treatment , many can recover and live healthy , productive lives*****1
we must encourage them to open up , and when they do , we must listen to them and take their cries for help seriously*****0
it was n't that long ago that a diagnosis of cancer was a tightly - kept secret that many victims of the deadly malady kept from family members , friends and especially employers*****0
but that changed dramatically over the years as people with cancer , their family members and caregivers came together to educate and change public opinion about the disease*****0
similarly , and with the courageous example of @entity89 , we 've seen perceptions about @entity87 change for the better , as people learn more about what it is and is n't*****0
time to talk about depression that 's the kind of transformation we need around perceptions of mental illness through a better - informed public discussion*****1
we have to put policies in place that encourage more openness without the severe repercussions people with mental illness fear*****1
that includes enforcing and even strengthening the kind of protections we already have in place ( through laws and regulations like the @entity113 for @entity114 ) for individuals who disclose their disability*****0
we also need to address the dilemma health care providers often face when they feel that strict patient privacy requirements inhibit them from alerting others to behaviors that could pose a public risk*****0
it 's a difficult balance*****0
sooner rather than later , policy leaders need to explore a way to provide greater flexibility in patient privacy regulations to enable health care providers to identify seriously ill persons who could potentially pose a harm to innocent people*****0
at the same time , we must reassure those who forthrightly reveal their struggles with mental illness that they can still carry on their lives in ways that will be valuable to their communities , families and employers*****1
that can start with urging employers not to dismiss anyone who discloses his or her mental illness and to retrain them for other appropriate positions*****1
if companies ban them from the workforce or from other roles in society , we will just be shifting the problem elsewhere and perpetuating the stigma that dangerously drives them underground*****0
we wo n't pretend that this is an easy problem to solve*****0
but , awful as @entity158 9525 tragedy was , the case may galvanize a discussion and reexamination that is long overdue*****0
we need to build awareness and support for those who suffer from mental illness .*****1
