( @entity0 ) the @entity2 presidential campaign surely anticipated the coming wave of inquiries and criticism about conflicts of interest involving big foreign donors to charities run by the @entity11 family -- questions set to get a thorough airing in a new book called " @entity15 : the @entity16 and @entity17 " by @entity18 , coming out may 5 . my guess is that the issues raised by the book will prompt @entity11 to put its candidate on the road , where she can continue holding loosely scheduled , informal meetings with ordinary @entity26 -- the sorts of people more concerned about local jobs than whether some foreign government or company paid a big speaking fee to @entity33 in hopes of getting special treatment by secretary of state @entity2 . it 's not that the alleged conflicts are n't potentially serious ; as i recently noted in these pages , they are . according to @entity44 , in 2014 the @entity45 " received money from the @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 , among others . the donors included @entity48 's foreign affairs department , which is promoting the @entity49 . " that 's the same @entity49 from @entity48 that the @entity51 all but endorsed , concluding after a five - part analysis that ran to 17,000 pages that the project 's environmental impact would be minimal . president @entity56 vetoed a bill that would have allowed the pipeline to be built , but it 's legitimate to ask whether the donation from @entity48 directly or indirectly influenced the @entity51 's analysis . and several news outlets have reported that banks and other companies with business before the @entity26 government were donors to the @entity68 , a sister group that was spun off from the @entity45 . @entity0 's @entity69 wrote last month that " listings for the @entity68 's @entity71 found partnerships with at least six banks that were under investigation , involved in litigation or had been fined by government agencies and regulators at the time of the meeting . in every case , the bank in question was listed as a sponsor of the event even after the investigations were widely reported in the media . " those are serious matters -- but so are stubborn unemployment , troubled schools , high taxes and other problems that top the list of voters ' concerns . a bank giving money to charity in hopes of buying leniency from the government is a cause for concern , but until and unless a smoking gun appears in the form of a clear exchange of money for favors , it becomes hard to say what , exactly , is wrong with donating cash to aid in a good cause like combating world hunger or helping to rebuild @entity113 . even among the banks fined for wrongdoing that contributed to @entity11 charities , noted @entity125 , " there 's no indication the @entity116 had any knowledge of the ongoing investigations into banks supporting the foundation 's efforts . " that does n't leave much room for outrage . a more serious critique of the @entity11 foundations is that they have been an administrative and financial quagmire from their origins , running deficits , expanding uncontrollably and cutting deals that not only raise ethical questions but cast the family 's management skill in a less - than - flattering light . in a well - known case of deception , a con man named @entity141 charmed his way into the foundation 's good graces , earning public praise from @entity33 for promising $ 50 million to the @entity68 -- money that never materialized . a more serious problem developed internally , with staff members fighting over the direction and management of the charities . in 2007 and 2008 , the foundation ran a $ 40 million deficit and in 2012 had an $ 8 million deficit . so we already knew that the @entity116 ' charities suffered from poor management and took money from companies and governments that were clearly trying to curry favor . it 's distasteful , but by now it 's not news . unless the forthcoming book unveils some blockbuster new information , questions about the @entity116 ' charities is likely to wind up on the same political shelf on which voters seem to have parked concerns about @entity2 's use of private emails to conduct @entity51 business . according to a recent poll by the rightward - leaning @entity176 -- taken after the email issue was splashed all over the news -- a survey of voters likely to vote in 2016 found that 57 % expect @entity11 to win the presidency . no wonder @entity11 seemed positively unconcerned about the forthcoming book . " we 're back into the political scene , and therefore we will be subjected to all kinds of distractions and i 'm ready for it , " she said in @entity185 . calling extensive exposure of conflicts of interest " distractions " suggests that @entity11 knows what the polls suggest : that in a nation still struggling to emerge from a long recession , voters will likely judge her on something other than the efficiency and ethics of her charities .

( @entity0 ) the @entity2 presidential campaign surely anticipated the coming wave of inquiries and criticism about conflicts of interest involving big foreign donors to charities run by the @entity11 family -- questions set to get a thorough airing in a new book called " @entity15 : the @entity16 and @entity17 " by @entity18 , coming out may 5*****1
my guess is that the issues raised by the book will prompt @entity11 to put its candidate on the road , where she can continue holding loosely scheduled , informal meetings with ordinary @entity26 -- the sorts of people more concerned about local jobs than whether some foreign government or company paid a big speaking fee to @entity33 in hopes of getting special treatment by secretary of state @entity2*****1
it 's not that the alleged conflicts are n't potentially serious ; as i recently noted in these pages , they are*****1
according to @entity44 , in 2014 the @entity45 " received money from the @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 , among others*****0
the donors included @entity48 's foreign affairs department , which is promoting the @entity49*****1
" that 's the same @entity49 from @entity48 that the @entity51 all but endorsed , concluding after a five - part analysis that ran to 17,000 pages that the project 's environmental impact would be minimal*****1
president @entity56 vetoed a bill that would have allowed the pipeline to be built , but it 's legitimate to ask whether the donation from @entity48 directly or indirectly influenced the @entity51 's analysis*****0
and several news outlets have reported that banks and other companies with business before the @entity26 government were donors to the @entity68 , a sister group that was spun off from the @entity45*****1
@entity0 's @entity69 wrote last month that " listings for the @entity68 's @entity71 found partnerships with at least six banks that were under investigation , involved in litigation or had been fined by government agencies and regulators at the time of the meeting*****0
in every case , the bank in question was listed as a sponsor of the event even after the investigations were widely reported in the media*****0
" those are serious matters -- but so are stubborn unemployment , troubled schools , high taxes and other problems that top the list of voters ' concerns*****0
a bank giving money to charity in hopes of buying leniency from the government is a cause for concern , but until and unless a smoking gun appears in the form of a clear exchange of money for favors , it becomes hard to say what , exactly , is wrong with donating cash to aid in a good cause like combating world hunger or helping to rebuild @entity113*****1
even among the banks fined for wrongdoing that contributed to @entity11 charities , noted @entity125 , " there 's no indication the @entity116 had any knowledge of the ongoing investigations into banks supporting the foundation 's efforts*****1
" that does n't leave much room for outrage*****0
a more serious critique of the @entity11 foundations is that they have been an administrative and financial quagmire from their origins , running deficits , expanding uncontrollably and cutting deals that not only raise ethical questions but cast the family 's management skill in a less - than - flattering light*****1
in a well - known case of deception , a con man named @entity141 charmed his way into the foundation 's good graces , earning public praise from @entity33 for promising $ 50 million to the @entity68 -- money that never materialized*****1
a more serious problem developed internally , with staff members fighting over the direction and management of the charities*****0
in 2007 and 2008 , the foundation ran a $ 40 million deficit and in 2012 had an $ 8 million deficit*****0
so we already knew that the @entity116 ' charities suffered from poor management and took money from companies and governments that were clearly trying to curry favor*****0
it 's distasteful , but by now it 's not news*****0
unless the forthcoming book unveils some blockbuster new information , questions about the @entity116 ' charities is likely to wind up on the same political shelf on which voters seem to have parked concerns about @entity2 's use of private emails to conduct @entity51 business*****1
according to a recent poll by the rightward - leaning @entity176 -- taken after the email issue was splashed all over the news -- a survey of voters likely to vote in 2016 found that 57 % expect @entity11 to win the presidency*****1
no wonder @entity11 seemed positively unconcerned about the forthcoming book*****1
" we 're back into the political scene , and therefore we will be subjected to all kinds of distractions and i 'm ready for it , " she said in @entity185*****0
calling extensive exposure of conflicts of interest " distractions " suggests that @entity11 knows what the polls suggest : that in a nation still struggling to emerge from a long recession , voters will likely judge her on something other than the efficiency and ethics of her charities .*****1
