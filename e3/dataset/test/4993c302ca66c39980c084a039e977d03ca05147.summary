( @entity1 ) people have long underestimated the athleticism necessary for golf*****0
but over the last decade , with fit golfers like @entity7 , @entity8 , and now @entity9 all winning the masters , the training perspective on golf is shifting*****1
there 's a particular emphasis on the functional movement required to execute the perfect swing , which is why yoga is increasingly appealing to golfers*****1
during the masters , @entity9 demonstrated optimal movement in two key areas that enhance swing power and fluid control while decreasing the risk of back and knee injuries : mid-back mobility and internal hip rotation*****1
equally important , he did it while maintaining a stable low back and integrated core strength as the foundation for expressing his swing mobility*****1
related : yoga for triathletes remember @entity7 's low - back problem earlier this year ? @entity7 blamed a lack of glute ( primary buttock muscle ) firing for locking up his back , but attempting to rotate from his low back instead of moving functionally from his mid back or hips likely exacerbated the issue*****1
when golfers have mobility limitations in their mid back or hips , they compensate with their low back and knees , which not only hampers play but often leads to pain and injury*****1
want the mobility to swing like @entity9 and avoid the back and knee issues that commonly plague golfers ? try these three yoga - based moves i use with my @entity58 clients to address the key areas of the swing*****1
trains internal hip rotation ; stabilizes and lengthens lower back muscles ; stretches upper back and shoulders ; encourages ankle mobility start in a neutral all - fours position with your hips over your knees and your shoulders above your wrists*****1
engage your deep core muscles to stabilize your low back*****1
extend your right leg straight out to the side with your toes pointing forward and the sole of your foot down*****0
exhale as you sit your hips back toward your heels as far as you can go comfortably without knee , hip or back pain*****1
inhale as you bring your body weight forward again and internally rotate from your right hip to come up onto your toes ( as pictured )*****0
be sure the rotation is coming from your hip , not your lower back , knees or ankles*****1
exhale and return your hips back towards your heels and the sole of your foot to the floor*****0
repeat the movement in synch with your breathing through five repetitions on each side*****0
promotes proper mid-back extension ; strengthens shoulder girdle , opens front of shoulders and chest ; lengthens low back lie prone ( belly down ) on your forearms with your elbows under your shoulders*****1
exhale as you press down through your forearms as though you are trying to slide your belly through your arms to create length in your low back*****1
at the same time , move your shoulder blades down toward your waist*****0
this will activate the mid-back muscles essential for thoracic spine extension while inhibiting the muscles of your upper neck and chest that limit mobility*****0
hold the posture for three long , deep breaths*****0
rest for a breath or two and repeat for a total of three holds*****0
promotes thoracic spine rotation and shoulder girdle function ; stabilizes low back ; activates glutes ( primary muscles of the buttocks ) ; encourages ankle mobility , strengthens adductors ( groins ) , core and legs stand with your feet together ; your big toes should touch but allow space between your heels to avoid externally rotating your hips*****1
exhale as you sit back into a squat with your hands and forearms together in front of your chest*****0
inhale as you hold the position , ensuring that your low back does n't arch , and your glutes and core are activated for support*****1
exhale as you rotate from your mid back to place your inside elbow on the top or outside of one leg*****0
keep your hips and low back stable*****1
avoid separating your knees or letting one drop forward*****0
inhale as you use your bottom elbow for leverage to reach your top elbow upward while pulling your hands toward the center of your chest*****0
exhale as you focus on dropping your shoulder blades down your back and rotating from your mid back*****0
you can look up or down — whatever is comfortable for your neck*****0
hold the twist for two more breaths*****0
repeat on the opposite side*****0
as an advanced option , you can hold one of your clubs ( as pictured ) , reaching your top hand up the club during the twist to open your shoulder and chest*****0
adding these yoga - based moves to your workouts will help you develop the mobility for an optimal swing*****1
but it 's up to you to add skill to the movement*****0
to that end , there are many golf trainers who focus on body mechanics with skill training*****0
according to its website , the @entity188 ( @entity189 ) educates instructors on " how a properly functioning body allows a player to swing a golf club in the most efficient way possible*****0
" so , if you really want to swing like @entity9 , you might consider hiring a @entity189 - certified trainer since the training staff @entity9 thanked during his @entity199 victory speech were all @entity189 certified .*****1
