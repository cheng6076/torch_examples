( @entity7 ) since the headline - grabbing murder of @entity4 journalist @entity3 by @entity6 militants eight months ago , the world has been regularly confronted with a modern form of an ancient , primally horrifying method of execution . @entity12 and @entity4 aid workers , @entity14 and @entity4 journalists , @entity16 and @entity17 soldiers and @entity19 and now @entity20 @entity18 were among those who followed in @entity3 's wake : their gruesome beheadings documented on camera and disseminated as propaganda to a global online audience . these highly ritualized killings have galvanized international opposition to the group -- and helped attract a wave of foreign recruits to the @entity6 cause . but beyond this , some experts such as psychology professor @entity35 suggest , the wave of savage beheadings may be having an unlikely knock - on effect . he says the spate of jihadist beheadings may be encouraging copy - cat acts or threats of decapitation -- not only from @entity44 , but from the " disbelievers " they target . @entity35 , distinguished professor of psychology at the @entity47 , says the frequent , high profile reports of @entity6 beheadings could result in psychologically " priming " people to be more inclined to emulate them , or threaten to , during moments of conflict or extreme stress . because of the attention that jihadist beheadings have commanded internationally , " the very concept of beheading , that was virtually non-existent in our unconscious prior to these events being propagated , is now there , " he told @entity7 . " it comes to mind when a conflict happens , when you react aggressively , " he said . " it sits there in our unconscious and can be activated under certain circumstances when the passions run high , and result in actual behavior . " reports of beheadings also emerge from @entity74 , where it is a legal method of execution under the country 's judicial code ; and @entity79 and @entity80 , where it is typically the work of criminal gangs . but neither has placed the practice in the global spotlight to anything like the same degree as @entity6 's propaganda , in which the threat is extended to " disbelievers " around the globe . a similar copy - cat effect had been observed with the phenomenon of school mass shootings , said @entity35 . " once the idea is planted then when someone is upset , feeling violent , the idea of getting a gun and shooting up a school comes more readily to mind , because it 's sitting there in our unconscious , " he said . a lack of hard data on the global incidence of beheadings makes it impossible to say conclusively whether such killings are being carried out by non-jihadists more often . but reports of such cases have been frequently making the headlines . in december and january , two victims were decapitated -- outside a @entity114 home , and in a shopping mall in @entity118 's @entity117 province -- in crimes with no apparent connection to terror . in @entity128 alone , a city deeply impacted by the murder and attempted decapitation of soldier @entity126 by @entity44 extremists in 2013 , three women were reportedly beheaded last year in alleged crimes with no apparent jihadist motivation . and in the @entity4 , an @entity132 man is awaiting trial , accused of beheading a co-worker in september . ( whether he was inspired by @entity6 propaganda remains unclear ; he was reportedly a recent convert to @entity44 and had posted @entity136 and beheading content online . ) whether or not " non-jihadist " beheadings are on the increase , this brutal method of killing has inarguably come to occupy a larger part of the public consciousness , as @entity6 's beheadings have grabbed international headlines and the terror group 's call on supporters to attack " disbelievers " has reverberated worldwide . in @entity152 and the @entity153 , jihad - related threats or plots to decapitate have allegedly been made in the past seven months ; recently , a @entity154 convert in @entity128 was found guilty of a plot to behead a @entity12 soldier , inspired by the @entity126 murder . the theme of beheading was also front and center in an incident in @entity162 in january , where fans of football team @entity164 unfurled a giant banner depicting the severed head of an opponent . the club condemned their actions as " totally unacceptable . " beyond this , threats to behead also seem to have gained a wider currency among non-jihadists , said @entity35 . in the @entity4 , a @entity175 man was arrested in january for threatening to decapitate the @entity177 police officer who put @entity178 in a fatal choke hold , which triggered widespread civil rights protests . and months earlier , in october , police reportedly received a threat to behead elementary school students in @entity184 . @entity185 , a professor of crime , policing , security and justice at the @entity190 said the @entity6 beheadings may have shown those engaging in attention - seeking threats of violence a sure way to get noticed . " an awareness of what really shocks and gets ' news ' is clearly on show , " he said . the threats and banner demonstrated the way in which the spread of beheading rhetoric may be having a psychologically " brutalizing " effect on society , said @entity35 , intensifying the violence of our thoughts , words and actions . " ultimately , we 're talking about contributing to the brutalization of interpersonal and inter-group conflict all over the planet , " he said . @entity217 , a senior lecturer in international relations and comparative politics at the @entity220 , said that while @entity6 beheadings " might inspire some people to prefer that particular way to kill people as opposed to others , " he believed it would eventually fall out of favor . while beheading had been adopted by @entity6 as their stock in trade , it would inevitably lose its shock value , driving jihadists to ramp up the levels of atrocity in order to continue capturing international attention . one such dramatic escalation occurred in february , when @entity6 released a propaganda video in which the tactic of beheading was abandoned altogether for fresh horrors -- burning @entity245 pilot @entity243 alive in a cage . later that month , @entity6 released a video released showing what appeared to be @entity16 @entity250 fighters paraded down @entity252 streets in cages . for many , a baffling aspect to the executions has been how such overweening brutality could win support for the @entity6 cause . while the executions are viewed by the vast majority of people as repellent , @entity35 said , they could exert a strong pull for sympathizers by projecting " a sense of godlike power . " " we all have this morbid , instinctual fascination with death and killing and torture , which is sublimated and constrained by civilization and our culture and socialization , " he said . " most of us are peaceful even though these drives exist in our subconscious ; civilization rests on its ability to constrain them . " but when the " death instinct " -- " this drive to kill and promote violence " -- was legitimized by a powerful narrative , such as a religious or ideological call to global jihad , " then that can result in unregulated atrocities , " he said . for some foreign jihadists who had traveled to @entity252 and @entity17 to fight for @entity6 , the realities of the so - called " @entity289 " had driven them to return home disenchanted , he said . but others remained .
