( @entity1 ) a white police officer claims he feared for his life and is justified in killing an unarmed black man*****0
a police chief supports the police officer , who is ultimately exonerated , and a predominantly black community seethes with rage because it knows that an injustice was done*****0
we 've seen this movie before*****0
spoiler alert : cop gets away with it*****0
routine stops for walking in the middle of the street or driving with a broken taillight -- these should not result in anyone 's death*****0
but time and again it ends with a black man dead in the street and the community has no recourse*****0
this time the stage was set in @entity26 , @entity27 , a city of about 100,000 people*****0
@entity29 was stopped by officer @entity30 for a broken taillight , and within minutes @entity29 was dead*****0
according to the incident report , @entity30 said : " shots fired , and the subject is down*****0
he took my @entity35*****0
" his attorney at the time , @entity38 , said that @entity30 " felt threatened and reached for his department - issued firearm and fired his weapon*****0
" but then came the video*****0
we watched in horror as we saw @entity30 shoot @entity29 in the back multiple times*****0
then we saw @entity30 pick up something from one location and place it near @entity29 's lifeless body*****1
on tuesday , the officer was arrested on murder charges*****0
@entity26 police chief @entity53 told reporters , " i have watched the video , and i was sickened by what i saw*****1
" apparently so was @entity30 's attorney , who announced after the video was made public that he was no longer representing the officer*****1
after the video became public , the officials in @entity26 deftly handled the situation*****1
however , it was an easy case*****0
there is no plausible evidence that @entity30 feared for his life when @entity29 is seen running away*****0
in @entity71 , the video we have in the death of @entity70 is of press conferences with police chief @entity73 , who refused to release the police officer 's name , but did release a video that appeared to show @entity70 stealing cigars*****1
we have the video of the military weapons deployed by the police in @entity71 that were trained on its residents and the press*****0
the world seethed*****0
@entity26 's police force is about 80 % white , with a population of 47 % black and 37 % white in the city*****1
@entity71 's police force is 94 % white ( only three of the 53 police officers are black ) , and the city is 67 % black and 29 % white*****1
both @entity26 and @entity71 have police forces that are not representative of the population they serve , yet because of a video @entity26 's police force got in front of the story*****1
i 'm not sure @entity26 gets here without learning something from the mistakes of @entity71*****0
i have heard many commentators say the @entity26 shooting does n't have anything to do with race*****1
i do n't buy it*****0
i wonder how many whites in @entity26 with broken taillights get pulled over ? being pulled over for driving while black is a well - known phenomenon , which i discuss in my " @entity113 " casebook*****1
racial profiling by @entity30 could have been the catalyst for @entity29 being pulled over in the first place*****0
yes , the @entity26 officials behaved differently than the officials in @entity71*****0
i do n't think it 's because race had nothing to do with it*****0
it is that perhaps the @entity26 officials are better than those in @entity71 when it comes to racially charged situations -- especially given the instructive fallout from @entity70 's shooting*****1
and , of course , the video*****0
it remains to be seen whether @entity30 will be convicted of murder*****0
strange things can happen in a jury room*****0
recall how the @entity135 videotape allowed a @entity137 , @entity138 , jury to acquit the @entity140 police officers , but a federal jury later convicted the officers of violating @entity135 's civil rights*****0
what a video proves can sometimes be in the eye of the beholder .*****0
