( @entity7 ) the jailing of four @entity2 security guards , eight years after they killed 17 @entity4 civilians in a shooting in @entity6 , is a positive step for justice -- but is also not enough . the kind of horror represented by the @entity2 case and others like it -- from @entity14 to the massacre at @entity16 to @entity18 waterboarding -- may be largely absent from public memory in the @entity20 these days , but it is being used by the @entity21 in @entity4 and @entity22 ( @entity23 ) to support its sectarian narrative . in its propaganda , @entity23 has been using @entity14 and other cases of @entity28 abuse to legitimize its current actions in @entity4 as the latest episodes in over a decade of constant " @entity32 resistance " to " @entity34 aggression " and to " shiite betrayal " — as phrased in an @entity23 publication from late 2014 titled " the @entity37 , " which chronicles the rise of @entity23 since 2003 . as the @entity4 government today struggles to regain the support of @entity32 in its fight against @entity23 -- or even renew @entity43 trust -- this invocation of @entity34 transgressions by @entity23 should be a sobering reminder of the importance of good governance in the pursuit of a solution to the unrest in @entity4 . the lack of accountability in the aftermath of the @entity34 intervention in @entity4 not only paved the way for abuses like @entity14 and @entity2 , it also fuelled sectarian tension in the country -- and today @entity23 is reaping the benefits . the @entity34 poured money into @entity4 after the 2003 invasion , but it did not make this support contingent upon a fair distribution of power and resources by the @entity4 government . this enabled the @entity69 - dominated government of former prime minister @entity70 to discriminate against the @entity32 community . the @entity34 was also sloppy in relying on private security firms like @entity2 without implementing rigorous measures to regulate their behavior . it also turned a blind eye to the way its own troops were treating @entity4 . all those factors contributed to a rising sense of injustice that is now being conveniently packaged by @entity23 to push its own version of @entity4 history . in " the revived caliphate , " @entity14 is invoked three times as the place where @entity4 sunnis who resisted the @entity34 ended up as a result of their betrayal by @entity69 who collaborated with the @entity34 . the publication first recounts attacks on @entity14 at the height of the @entity34 intervention by @entity94 in @entity4 ( @entity95 ) -- @entity23 ' predecessor -- to free imprisoned " sunnis " who had been detained by the @entity34 . it then presents the @entity99 ( awakening ) of 2007 -- when @entity32 tribes collaborated with the @entity34 to fight @entity95 -- as a case of @entity104 resentment that led the tribes to hand over @entity95 members " to the @entity34 , where they were put through severe torture in the likes of the prisons of @entity14 , " according to the publication . it then links those two stories to the storming of the prison by @entity23 in 2013 to free those who had been tortured by " the @entity34 and @entity69 " ( as the publication puts it ) over ten years . in bridging a decade of history and in placing the @entity69 squarely in the category of " enemy , " @entity23 is sending a strong message that its current fight in @entity4 is about reversing longstanding injustices against @entity32 and restoring a sense of @entity32 belonging under the umbrella of the " caliphate .

( @entity7 ) the jailing of four @entity2 security guards , eight years after they killed 17 @entity4 civilians in a shooting in @entity6 , is a positive step for justice -- but is also not enough*****1
the kind of horror represented by the @entity2 case and others like it -- from @entity14 to the massacre at @entity16 to @entity18 waterboarding -- may be largely absent from public memory in the @entity20 these days , but it is being used by the @entity21 in @entity4 and @entity22 ( @entity23 ) to support its sectarian narrative*****1
in its propaganda , @entity23 has been using @entity14 and other cases of @entity28 abuse to legitimize its current actions in @entity4 as the latest episodes in over a decade of constant " @entity32 resistance " to " @entity34 aggression " and to " shiite betrayal " — as phrased in an @entity23 publication from late 2014 titled " the @entity37 , " which chronicles the rise of @entity23 since 2003*****1
as the @entity4 government today struggles to regain the support of @entity32 in its fight against @entity23 -- or even renew @entity43 trust -- this invocation of @entity34 transgressions by @entity23 should be a sobering reminder of the importance of good governance in the pursuit of a solution to the unrest in @entity4*****1
the lack of accountability in the aftermath of the @entity34 intervention in @entity4 not only paved the way for abuses like @entity14 and @entity2 , it also fuelled sectarian tension in the country -- and today @entity23 is reaping the benefits*****1
the @entity34 poured money into @entity4 after the 2003 invasion , but it did not make this support contingent upon a fair distribution of power and resources by the @entity4 government*****1
this enabled the @entity69 - dominated government of former prime minister @entity70 to discriminate against the @entity32 community*****0
the @entity34 was also sloppy in relying on private security firms like @entity2 without implementing rigorous measures to regulate their behavior*****0
it also turned a blind eye to the way its own troops were treating @entity4*****0
all those factors contributed to a rising sense of injustice that is now being conveniently packaged by @entity23 to push its own version of @entity4 history*****1
in " the revived caliphate , " @entity14 is invoked three times as the place where @entity4 sunnis who resisted the @entity34 ended up as a result of their betrayal by @entity69 who collaborated with the @entity34*****0
the publication first recounts attacks on @entity14 at the height of the @entity34 intervention by @entity94 in @entity4 ( @entity95 ) -- @entity23 ' predecessor -- to free imprisoned " sunnis " who had been detained by the @entity34*****1
it then presents the @entity99 ( awakening ) of 2007 -- when @entity32 tribes collaborated with the @entity34 to fight @entity95 -- as a case of @entity104 resentment that led the tribes to hand over @entity95 members " to the @entity34 , where they were put through severe torture in the likes of the prisons of @entity14 , " according to the publication*****0
it then links those two stories to the storming of the prison by @entity23 in 2013 to free those who had been tortured by " the @entity34 and @entity69 " ( as the publication puts it ) over ten years*****0
in bridging a decade of history and in placing the @entity69 squarely in the category of " enemy , " @entity23 is sending a strong message that its current fight in @entity4 is about reversing longstanding injustices against @entity32 and restoring a sense of @entity32 belonging under the umbrella of the " caliphate*****1
" the civilians killed by the @entity2 guards , like the @entity14 prisoners , were both @entity32 and @entity69*****0
but the repackaging of history by @entity23 -- in which the @entity132 regime is reinvented as a " @entity32 " regime that tried to stand up to the @entity34 and its @entity69 allies -- glosses over those nuances*****1
the reproduced images of @entity14 prisoners in the aforementioned @entity23 publication , juxtaposed with images of civilian deaths as a result of @entity34 airstrikes against @entity23 targets , are presented as " proof " of the group 's narrative*****0
and they are reinforced with text that frames @entity34 today as " the air force of the @entity69*****0
" it is becoming clear that @entity23 can not be defeated in @entity4 without buy - in from the country 's @entity32*****1
without @entity32 help , @entity23 will continue to frame the conflict as one where @entity32 are once again being attacked by the @entity34 and the @entity69 -- particularly as @entity69 militias have become a key part of the fight against the terror group in places like @entity160*****1
to balance out this @entity69 involvement , the @entity34 and @entity4 governments are counting on the establishment of a cross-sectarian @entity4 national guard , and hoping to resurrect the " awakening " to re-engage and unify the @entity32 under a nationalist umbrella*****0
but those plans will not succeed unless serious steps are taken to ensure that good governance measures are in place to hold both @entity4 and all those affiliated with the @entity173 coalition to account*****0
this should not just apply in the context of the current conflict -- so that scenarios like @entity14 and @entity2 are not repeated -- but also when the dust settles*****0
