( @entity1 ) in case you needed a reminder that president @entity5 is n't running for office again , he just alienated not only @entity7 , who have largely resented him from day one , but the progressive base of @entity10 voters*****0
@entity5 has argued with the progressive potentate @entity12 , calling her " wrong " on trade policy*****1
the @entity15 senator is the same potentate to whom @entity17 has been religiously prostrating*****0
what everyone does next will be critical for the 2016 elections and the future of @entity10 politics*****0
@entity23 has publicly criticized so - called " fast track " trade authority that would allow the @entity25 to negotiate massive , multination trade deals with little congressional oversight*****1
the authority would pave the way for trade pacts such as the @entity32 , which is modeled on the @entity33 , and has killed 700,000 @entity35 jobs and drove wages down in the @entity35 while simultaneously decimating @entity38 agriculture and small businesses*****1
aspects of the @entity32 deal would provide incentives for off - shoring jobs to low - wage countries , imposing limits on government regulations around food safety and the environment , and create mechanisms for multinational corporations to challenge any domestic laws they simply do n't like*****0
in december , @entity23 wrote a letter signed by several other democrats to @entity35 trade representative @entity55 raising concerns about the @entity32*****0
the letter warned that the @entity32 could erode safeguards that have been put in place to " prevent future financial crises*****0

at a town hall with @entity68 's @entity67 on tuesday , president @entity5 said , " i love @entity12*****1
we 're allies on a whole host of issues*****0
but she 's wrong on this*****0
" @entity5 added , " when you hear folks make a lot of suggestions about how bad this trade deal is , when you dig into the facts , they are wrong*****1

meanwhile , @entity17 is trying to walk a fine line somewhere in the middle*****0
@entity88 has recently courted @entity23 's support while forcefully repeating the rhetoric of populism*****0
but according to a report by @entity94 , @entity88 's staff is at pains to suggest that @entity88 has always been a populist as opposed to merely trying to now co-opt a current trend*****0
yet it becomes harder to paint @entity88 as the " original @entity12 " each time she equivocates on trade policy and the @entity32*****1
in a 2012 speech as secretary of state , @entity88 praised the @entity32 as " the gold standard in trade agreements to open free , transparent , fair trade , the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field*****0

so does @entity88 support the @entity32 deal or not ? campaigning in @entity121 on tuesday , @entity88 reportedly declined to say one way or the other*****0
that 's not the behavior of a fierce populist*****0
it 's more indicative of the sort of politically calculated , ideologically centrist " triangulation " for which her husband was famous*****0
seizing on @entity88 's ambiguity , her potential challenger in the @entity10 primary , @entity135 , released a video this week making clear that he is against the @entity32*****0
according to a poll , as of 2012 just 1 in 4 @entity35 believed that @entity33 had benefited @entity35 workers and only 1 in 3 believed it had benefited the @entity35 economy overall*****0

" in other words , any political leader with even the dimmest grasp of economics let alone political pragmatism should run away from a new trade deal modeled on imitating and expanding @entity33*****0
while it 's not surprising that @entity7 are siding with big business and against working @entity35 in supporting the @entity32 , it 's befuddling that president @entity5 supports it*****0
the only hope now is for 2016 @entity10 candidates , especially @entity88 at this point , to support populism not just in rhetoric but in real policy terms and show which party is , for the most part , on the side of the people and not on the side of multinational corporations*****0
