@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) the streets were empty but not quiet*****0
@entity4 began to boom through the @entity1 city of @entity0 on thursday afternoon as we hurried back to board the boat that had brought us here from @entity8*****0
@entity0 is a city gripped by fear , desperation and want*****0
people line up for bread , they line up for cooking fuel , and the electricity only works a few hours a day*****1
and from late afternoon onward , most people stay indoors*****1
that is the time of the shelling , the daily aerial bombardment*****0
how we got to @entity1 : 30 dangerous hours in a boat @entity24 began airstrikes on @entity27 rebels in @entity1 three weeks ago thursday*****1
but @entity0 remains a city not fully in the hands either of @entity27 rebels or forces loyal to the ousted government of president @entity33*****1
everyone we spoke to thursday told us the same thing : living in @entity0 these days is terrifying*****0
we visited a hospital where doctors have given up trying to count the dead and the dying who are brought in*****0
officials said they believe the toll of the dead runs into the hundreds*****0
everywhere , we felt , saw , heard and smelled the desperation*****0
we spoke to some of the loyalist military commanders*****0
they said they felt they were pushing back the @entity27 forces*****0
the @entity27 forced @entity33 from power in january , though @entity33 still claims to be @entity1 's legitimate leader and is working with the @entity24 and other allies to return to @entity1*****1
those allied with @entity33 have accused the @entity57 government of supporting the @entity27 in their uprising in @entity1*****1
' a window into hell ' : desperate @entity1 flee @entity24 airstrikes by boat since @entity24 began aerial raids march 26 , it has launched more than 1,200 airstrikes*****0
@entity24 officials said they have killed more than 500 @entity27 rebels*****1
but the reality is that a good portion of the armaments the @entity24 send in on guided parachutes fall instead into @entity27 hands*****1
there is , to be sure , a sense that three weeks into this operation , the @entity24 are making some headway with the strikes*****0
but given how far along they are into the operation , the expectation would have been -- especially given the aerial cover the @entity24 are providing for loyalist forces on the ground -- that the @entity27 forces would have been pushed further back*****1
that has n't happened*****0
why is @entity24 bombing @entity1 ? the government loyalists have gained territory ; that is why we were able to dock*****1
there is an area around one of the smaller ports that is reliably in government hands*****1
but @entity0 's main port will be hugely strategic for any potential ground incursion*****1
those forces will need to be reinforced and supplied through somewhere -- and the port is at the top of the list*****0
given that control of the city is still divided , there is a feeling that not enough of what the @entity24 set out to do has been accomplished*****1
the loyalists were frank with us*****0
we are outgunned , they said*****0
we are fighting a force that is superior to us in terms of its arms , tanks and artillery*****0
" we 're fighting them with automatic machine guns , " the loyalists told us*****0
" those reinforcements are n't getting in to us in time*****0
