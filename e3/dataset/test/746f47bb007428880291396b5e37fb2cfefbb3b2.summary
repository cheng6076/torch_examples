@entity5 , @entity2 ( @entity3 ) when @entity2 's biggest auto show opens in @entity5 this week , the only models on display will be the ones with four wheels*****1
gone , show organizers hope , will be the scantily - clad " car babes " that in previous years have posed provocatively on car hoods and sashayed through the aisles to draw crowds to the 9 - day event*****1
the focus , instead , will be the latest offerings from an array of global car manufacturers , which -- models or not -- are pulling out all the stops to compete for @entity2 customers in what since 2009 has been the world 's largest car market*****1
" it 's a major industry event for us , " said @entity24 , global product communications manager at @entity26*****1
it sells several hundred of its super-luxury vehicles in @entity2 each year , and in @entity5 this week will launch its latest model , the @entity33*****0
vehicle sales in @entity2 totaled 23.5 million units last year , almost a third more than in the @entity36*****0
however , the show comes at a turning point for @entity2 's auto market , which is facing a second year of slower growth in 2015 after a decade - long sales and production frenzy*****1
intense competition for @entity2 's drivers means that car manufacturers are increasingly developing vehicles that cater to @entity2 preferences*****1
@entity48 will use @entity49 2015 to unveil the @entity51 mid-size sedan , which it says has been specially created for " the rising young @entity2 generation*****1
" the country 's gearheads have embraced the suv or sport utility vehicle , sales of which jumped a third last year , and many will feature in the displays planned by dozens of @entity64 , @entity63 @entity36 , @entity62 and @entity2 automakers*****1
this year @entity65 , once known for its sleek sports cars and now owned by @entity67 , enters the fray with its first suv , the @entity70 , while @entity71 will give two new luxury suvs their @entity2 market debut -- the @entity74 and @entity75 , the latter favored by hip hop stars*****0
" the suv is popular as a first car , " said @entity78 , a @entity5 - based partner at @entity79*****1

@entity87 , which already exports to @entity96 , the @entity97 and @entity98 , is also stepping up its efforts to crack more developed markets*****0
it is preparing to export the @entity101 to the @entity36 from a factory in the southwestern city of @entity104*****0
it would be the first car made in @entity2 to hit @entity36 showrooms and may pave the way for @entity2 brands to shake up the @entity36 market like @entity63 and @entity112 car manufacturers did decades earlier*****1
with car ownership still at much lower levels than the @entity36 and @entity64 , @entity2 is likely to remain the industry 's most important market for decades*****1
however , the breakneck growth may be a thing of the past*****0
in 2014 , growth in sales halved to 7 % and according to the @entity123 , the slowdown continued in the first three months of this year when sales rose just 3.9 %*****0
it comes as the wider economy slows and a prolonged campaign against corruption has hit sales of luxury vehicles , especially brands like @entity131 that have been the ride of choice for @entity2 officials*****0
on top of that , the hassles of car ownership are deterring some potential buyers , as is an awareness of the environmental costs*****0
congested and chaotic roads , restrictions on the number of new vehicle license plates and a shortage of residential parking space may trigger a backlash against car ownership , according to a recent report from @entity79*****0
