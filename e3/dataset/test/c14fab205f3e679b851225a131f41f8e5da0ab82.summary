( @entity1 ) as the @entity0 of 2015 drags on , giving a whole new meaning to @entity4 's somewhat unfair noughties nickname , " @entity4 , " bets on the arrival of a new baby a girl continue to be placed at a feverish rate*****1
as of today , 70 % of those laying down their hard earned cash are convinced the world is on the verge of welcoming a new princess*****0
i suspect different parties are hoping for a girl for different reasons*****0
based on the so called " @entity22 " and subsequent " @entity23 , " the great @entity21 @entity20 is no doubt salivating at the prospect of record sales should hrh princess ( fill in the blank ) of @entity27 be spotted in one of their outfits*****1
as one headline blared this week , " baby girl could be worth $ 1.5 billion to the country*****1
" magazine and newspaper editors are well aware of the dramatic rise in sales when a royal baby hits the cover , especially a little girl*****1
and then there 's @entity43 , which will always appreciate princesses in the zeitgeist , but as with all things relating to the monarchy , there is also a far greater historical significance should a baby girl arrive*****1
there have been 34 @entity52 and only six @entity53 over the course of the @entity56 's thousand - year history , and yet some of the nation 's most enlightened times have occurred when a @entity60 has been on the throne*****1
@entity62 led the country through the @entity64 , and @entity66 and @entity60 -- the two longest reigning monarchs -- both made their mark with perhaps the most illustrious and progressive legacies of all*****0
while it is unlikely this child will ever be crowned , as the daughter of the second - in - line to the throne , her role will be significant*****1
prince @entity76 has made no secret of his desire to slim down the monarchy , but in looking at his family 's immediate bloodline -- @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 -- it stands to be a heavily male - dominated one*****1
in an institution viewed by some as archaic and out of touch , it is imperative to have a strong female presence*****0
princess @entity92 -- @entity85 's great - aunt -- grew up with three brothers , and was once described as , " the greatest king the country never had*****1
" she is patron of more than 200 charitable organizations and carries out some 500 public engagements a year*****0
a noted equestrian , she won two silver medals and a gold at the @entity102 , and was the first member of the royal family to compete at the @entity105*****1
more importantly she has supported her mother throughout her reign , flown the flag for @entity21 and promoted brand @entity109 around the world*****0
as the only girl born to @entity60 and @entity113 , she has matched and often surpassed the accomplishments of her brothers*****0
princesses @entity116 and @entity117 , also true blood princesses , are not " working members " of the royal family and generally only roll out for state and ceremonial occasions*****1
so , yes , it would be nice for the baby to be a girl so that we can all ooh and ah over frilly dresses , fairy wings and ballet shoes ( although as a @entity109 she 's more likely to be mucking out stables and shooting pheasant ) , but in truth the birth of a girl matters on a far deeper level : the monarchy needs a baby girl to fill the female void of future generations*****1
the 20th century was ushered in by @entity66 and the 21st by @entity140 live to eighty - seven he will be the first monarch of the 22nd century , but as i have said before the @entity21 monarchy is anything but predictable*****1
if punters are right and @entity83 and @entity4 do announce the birth of a baby girl as the rightful " spare , " it 's certainly possible that a seventh @entity60 may ring in the year 2100*****1
in the event the couple welcomes a boy , however , i sincerely hope there wo n't be a collective groan of disappointment heard around the world -- after all on the few occasions we have seen @entity85 he has been a veritable treat*****0
the birth of any baby is cause for celebration regardless of gender , race , religion or indeed status , and as prince @entity84 , the world 's most eligible bachelor has shown , games of naked billiards can sell magazines too*****1
