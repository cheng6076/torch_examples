( @entity0 ) a former @entity2 aircraft carrier that survived a @entity4 torpedo strike and was a massive guinea pig for two atomic bomb blasts looks remarkably intact at the bottom of the @entity8 , according to federal researchers who surveyed the wreck last month with an underwater drone . the @entity12 was scuttled in january 1951 during weapons testing near @entity15 's @entity14 . although its location was confirmed by a survey in 2009 , researchers from the @entity17 went looking for it again in march as part of a project to map about 300 wrecks that lie in and around the @entity25 . " after 64 years on the seafloor , @entity12 sits on the bottom as if ready to launch its planes , " mission leader @entity28 , the maritime heritage director for @entity17 's @entity29 , said in a statement . indeed , sonar images show what looks to be an airplane on one of the elevators that took planes from the @entity12 's hangar deck to its flight deck . the ship sits upright with a slight list to starboard , according to @entity17 . @entity17 's survey of the 623 - foot - long , 11,000 - ton carrier was conducted by the @entity45 , an 18.5 - foot - long autonomous underwater vehicle provided by the @entity47 @entity48 traveled 30 miles from its base in @entity50 , @entity15 , and hovered 150 above the carrier , which lies 2,600 feet below the surface of the @entity8 . the drone used a three - dimensional sonar system provided by @entity55 to get images that showed how well the warship has weathered 64 years in the deep . " this ship fought a long , hard war in the @entity8 and after the war was subjected to two atomic blasts that ripped through the ship . it is a reminder of the industrial might and skill of the ' greatest generation ' that sent not only this ship , but their loved ones to war , " @entity28 said in the statement . in its 20 years in the @entity2 , the ship played a role in some of the most important events of @entity77 , earning eight battle stars in the process , and the dawn of the nuclear age . @entity12 was seriously damaged by @entity4 torpedo planes during the @entity83 in late 1943 . the ship returned to @entity15 for repairs and made it back across the @entity8 by july 1944 to participate in the @entity87 and the sinking of one of the @entity91 's biggest warships , the battleship @entity93 . later , in the @entity95 , planes from the @entity12 were involved in the sinking of four @entity4 aircraft carriers . after the war , @entity12 became part of a fleet used to measure the effects of atomic bomb tests at @entity103 in the @entity8 on july 1 , 1946 . it sat just 560 yards from ground zero in the first test , a 23 - kiloton air blast of a fission bomb similar to the one used over @entity108 , @entity4 , a year earlier , according to the @entity109 . twenty - four days later , @entity12 was 1,390 yards from the center of a second atomic blast -- also a 23 - kiloton device but an underwater detonation . the ship was later brought back to @entity15 for nuclear decontamination before being sunk during the weapons training in 1951 . @entity17 said no signs of radioactive contamination were noted during the survey of the sunken carrier last month . the agency has no plans for further missions to the ship , according to the @entity17 statement .
