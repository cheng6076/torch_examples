@entity2 ( @entity1 ) @entity0 and her husband , @entity3 , were standing near the finish line on the day of the @entity5 . her feet were sore from wearing 4.5 - inch heels . still , they walked to @entity9 to watch the runners . " we were so in love and happy together , " she told a federal jury wednesday . it was the second day the @entity2 jury heard a procession of heartbreaking loss -- the survivors and families of those killed when twin bombs planted by the pair of brothers named @entity24 exploded near the finish line . the jury must decide whether bomber @entity24 , 21 , should live or die for what he has done . @entity0 and @entity3 , who had just returned from a tour in @entity29 with the @entity30 , were steps away from the explosion near the @entity33 . she recalled the force of the blast that killed three people and injured over 200 that april day in 2013 . she knew right away it was a terrorist attack . screams and heavy smoke filled the air . she could n't hear her own screams . she thought she was dead . when her husband , who also was injured , lifted her leg , he too let out a scream . she said she thought he was in shock . she rolled over onto her stomach and crawled over broken glass , shredding her arms . she dragged herself to the @entity33 . " i saw all five of my toes , but i saw a lot of blood , " she said . " i did n't see my ankle . " a ballroom dancer , @entity0 ' left leg would later be amputated below the knee . inside the forum , @entity0 begged for whiskey . " i just wanted the pain to go away . i only begged for the whiskey when i thought i was going to die . " when someone removed @entity3 's shoe , an artery was spurting blood . his face got whiter and whiter , she said . his eye rolled back . she thought he was dead . at a hospital , she called her parents on her cellphone . she told them she was in a terrorist attack . " i do n't think i have a left foot anymore , " she told her father . " i 'm in really bad shape and i really need to talk to you because this might be it . " her father told her he was driving and it was illegal to pull over . " i do n't care if it 's illegal . i need to talk to you because these might be our last words . i said i was in a terrorist attack at the @entity84 and @entity3 is dead and this might be it for me . " @entity0 told the jury that , at the @entity33 , her husband kept telling her he was sorry . " that was all he could say . that he loved me . he was so sorry . " her husband , she said , has since " bravely admitted himself into a mental facility at the @entity94 . " after her testimony , @entity0 walked slowly off the stand . she appeared to glare at @entity24 , who did not look at her . earlier this week , prosecutors showed jurors an image of @entity24 taken when he was in a holding cell . it was dated july 10 , 2013 -- the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately set off the deadly bombs . he glares into the camera defiantly , his middle finger raised in a gesture that assistant u.s. attorney @entity110 said showed a young man who was " unconcerned , unrepentant and unchanged . " on wednesday , @entity24 's lawyer , @entity112 , sought to discredit the use of the image . she suggested the gesture had been presented to the jury out of context . on cross-examination of a deputy @entity121 marshal , @entity118 showed the jury security footage from which the image was taken . in it , @entity24 is seen looking into the camera touching his hair . moments before , he has two fingers up , forming what @entity118 called a " v sign , " before raising his middle finger . @entity129 , a deputy @entity130 for 14 years , admitted that the camera was encased in a reflective surface and @entity24 could have been using it as a mirror . " a lot of times people do that to get our attention , " @entity134 said . also wednesday , @entity140 told the jury about her niece , @entity142 , a " beautiful nerd " and graduate student at @entity145 who was killed in the bombing . @entity142 was originally from @entity148 but was buried in @entity2 . " how she died , and why she died , it just felt like she is part of @entity2 , part of city , " her aunt said . " the thinking is she should just be here . " the family , @entity155 said , put a music box and some books in her casket . her mother put a bracelet on her wrist and touched her hand . later , her mother described her beautiful hand . @entity155 recalled what @entity142 's mother said to her : " ' no matter what i do n't want to believe it is her hand . ' " the brother and stepfather of @entity171 also took the stand wednesday . @entity171 was the @entity173 police officer who was shot in his patrol car , another victim of the @entity24 brothers as they tried to evade capture . @entity171 always wanted to be a cop , said his brother . he was a child who viewed life in terms of right and wrong . either you did it or you did n't . " we thought it was typical little boy stuff , but he never grew out of it , " @entity186 told the jury . " @entity171 was always the one to spill the beans , " said @entity191 , 59 , who married @entity171 's mother , @entity192 , in 1993 . " he was a cop from an early age . " on a thursday night in april 2013 , @entity173 police officer @entity171 lay bleeding in his patrol car after being ambushed and shot in the head . his car door was open , and his foot was lodged between the gas and brake pedals . the officer who found @entity171 testified at trial that he had wounds to the temple , neck and head . he was bleeding out as officers tried to revive him . @entity171 would become the fourth victim of the @entity24 brothers . the night still feels like a dream for @entity191 . " he had a hole in the middle of his head , " @entity191 said . " he was shot to pieces . he was just laying there . my wife was touching him , and his blood was coming up in her hands . " prosecution shows what it calls @entity24 's defiant message to @entity121 prosecutors said the brothers killed @entity171 because they wanted his gun . but their efforts to take it were thwarted by a safety holster . @entity229 , 26 , was killed in a chase and gunbattle with police that began with reports of an " officer down " at @entity173 . less than two weeks after @entity237 was found guilty on every count , the jury deciding his punishment is hearing about the lasting impact of his deeds . earlier , mit police chief @entity241 told the jury that he hired @entity171 , who fit in " perfectly " because of his policing style and engaging personality . the @entity173 police , who are designated as special officers by the @entity248 , patrol the sprawling campus in @entity250 . " the atmosphere of the department changed since april 18 , 2013 , " he said . " there is sadness and a sense of loss . i think that it will be there for as long as that generation of officers remains . it was remarkable the amount of support we got from the community , but @entity171 's death hangs like a weight . " @entity268 has come to question whether he wants to continue on the force . " policing is the only thing i 've done in my life , and i 've always tried to be good at what i do , " he said . " i lost one of my own . i have children at home and i 've always thought i would have been very , very proud for them to wear the uniform . now i 'm not so sure . " @entity191 said it took his wife , @entity192 , months to gain the strength to climb out of bed after losing her son . saturday was the second anniversary of the bombing . she cried all weekend . " she was very strong , " he said . " she was a happy person . she was a good mother . since @entity171 's death , she 's very scared of anything that might happen to any of the other children . " @entity192 became pregnant with @entity171 after losing a baby that lived for a day or two , @entity191 said . his birth lifted her out of depression . " he was special , " he said , adding that @entity171 is now buried alongside the baby . @entity191 said he still feels beat down two years later . " there 's something missing , " he said . " @entity298 and @entity299 will never be the same . " @entity171 's brother @entity186 said , " even when we 're having fun , there 's always a cloud over us . i miss @entity171 . i miss everything about him . " the prosecution is expected to rest friday , according to an official with insight into the prosecutor 's plans . poll : 53 % say @entity24 should face death penalty @entity314 and @entity315 reported from @entity2 , @entity316 wrote in @entity317 .
