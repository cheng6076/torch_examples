( @entity1 ) sunday 's announcement that @entity2 would shut down all of its remaining 28 campuses is a positive development in a long struggle to hold for - profit colleges accountable*****1
@entity2 , which once enrolled more than 70,000 students , is one of the worst of the " predator colleges " -- schools that offer dubious degrees , saddle students with high amounts of debt and gobble up tens of billions of dollars in federal money every year*****1
many of these schools are for - profit career colleges that operate mostly online*****1
it 's no wonder that @entity2 is doing this after the @entity23 @entity22 curtailed its access to federal student aid last summer*****0
there are about 1.3 million students enrolled in for - profit colleges , many of which have questionable track records , and their students need help transitioning into legitimate postsecondary schools*****1
with @entity37 's student loan debt sheet topping $ 1 trillion , we literally ca n't afford to continue funding for - profit colleges -- which reportedly get 86 % of their funding from federal student loan money*****1
for those not familiar with the for - profit college fiasco , here 's the whole story in one telling statistic : while for - profit colleges enroll only 13 % of the nation 's college students , such colleges account for nearly half of all student loan defaults , according to @entity22 statistics*****1
for comparison 's sake , the default rate of for - profit college students is worse than the default rate of the worst subprime borrowers during the financial crisis*****1
how do these colleges operate ? it 's deviously simple : convince low - income students into borrowing tens of thousands of dollars through easy federal student loans , keep costs low through online classes and part - time professors , and watch the money roll in*****1
the aggressive tactics of these colleges boggle the mind*****0
recruiters are told to make 100 phone calls and leave 100 messages a day , according to a @entity76 investigation*****0
i can personally attest to the aggressive tactics*****0
my phone number was accidentally placed on a call list for a for - profit college recently , and i received so many calls per day that i had to ask my wireless carrier to block the phone number*****1
stopping the exploitation of students is n't easy*****0
the for - profit college business is a multibillion - dollar industry*****1
the @entity89 of these companies make millions of dollars a year , employ an army of lobbyists and donate money to both political parties*****0
but the past two months brought a new twist to the crisis*****0
hundreds of graduates of the now - defunct @entity2 joined a " debt strike , " publicly declaring their refusal to pay back their loans*****1
in response , @entity22 secretary @entity101 signaled a willingness to forgive loans of @entity106 graduates who have crushing debt and no job prospects*****0
now that @entity2 is finally shutting down , we must finish the job*****0
the remaining for - profit colleges should be closed*****1
any student not gainfully employed or transferred to a reputable college within three years should be considered a victim , and their debts should be forgiven*****1
yes , " victim " is the right word*****0
if these degrees actually helped people get jobs , we should be celebrating them*****0
but according to a jaw - dropping report by the @entity22 , the average graduate of an online for - profit college makes less than a high school dropout*****1
not the equivalent of a high school dropout*****0
less than a high school dropout*****0
the real - life misery caused by predatory colleges is painful to hear about*****1
one @entity2 graduate has $ 37,000 in debt for his computer science degree , but he ca n't even get a job at @entity135 , according to @entity136*****0
another graduate , $ 33,000 in debt , has a medical assisting degree , but she gave up on finding employment in her field*****0
she waits tables now , @entity141 says*****0
i can already hear your next question*****0
if for - profit colleges are this terrible , are they at least cheaper ? no. in fact , their cost is reportedly around 60 % higher than a comparable degree from a public college*****1
what 's even more frustrating is that we 've known about the shenanigans of these predator colleges for years*****1
a 2011 report by the @entity157 found widespread rule breaking by the largest for - profit colleges -- everything from accepting fictitious high - school diplomas to encouraging plagiarism and cheating*****1
in one example , an undercover federal investigator posing as a student was told by a professor , " it 's not hard to get a 100 % on the second try ; just jot down the correct answers and take the quiz again , " according to the @entity168*****0
in 2013 , @entity173 paid $ 10 million to settle charges by the state of @entity176 regarding phony job - placement claims*****0
all told , no fewer than 36 state attorneys general were investigating for - profit colleges in 2014*****1
after selling off 95 of its campuses last year , @entity106 said on sunday that it tried unsuccessfully to sell the remaining 28 campuses , blaming the failure on " federal and state regulators seeking to impose financial penalties and conditions " on potential buyers*****0
you ca n't hide your bad behavior forever , and the questionable practices of many for - profit colleges are starting to catch up with them*****1
enrollment at the @entity195 -- the largest for - profit college in the @entity23 -- has fallen by half , to about 213,000*****1
we laid the smackdown on predatory lenders during the financial crisis , and it 's time to do the same thing with for - profit colleges*****1
to keep predator colleges from wrecking our faith in the college degree -- still the best pathway to a middle - class life -- we need to act now*****1
for - profit colleges have flunked their final exam*****1
now it 's up to their rich benefactor , @entity37 , to make sure they do n't go back to school in the fall*****0
editor 's note : an earlier version of this article said the @entity223 campus of the @entity195 had been banned from enrolling military veterans last year ; that issue has been resolved .*****0
