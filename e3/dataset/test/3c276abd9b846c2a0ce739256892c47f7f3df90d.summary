and while that does n't mean that he can do away with traditional materials like bricks , cement , and plaster , his system promotes a whole new idea of engineering*****0
@entity4 built a prototype house in his hometown of @entity19 , south of @entity20 , with his high school friend @entity21 , after years of research and development*****1
the house was built with a grant from the @entity26 , and showcases the " liquid engineering " concepts @entity4 has written about extensively*****1
panels , some of steel , and some of glass , make up the structure of the house and a sheet of water is trapped between the inner layers , which equalizes the temperature across the building*****1
the house is actually able to reheat itself , when its hot excess heat is stored either in the foundations of the building or in external storage , to be brought back to the walls when the temperature drops*****1
the indoor temperature can also be modified using a monitoring system similar to central heating*****0
this is a very efficient and sustainable system : the house can produce its own energy and be more independent of energy suppliers , which could reduce carbon emissions*****1
