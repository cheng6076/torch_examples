( @entity0 ) it came a day early . @entity2 investigators handed their files on @entity5 's death over to prosecutors thursday , but the public should n't expect much . it 's largely a procedural step , and given the overtures from @entity2 officials , the state 's attorney 's decision on whether to file charges against the six officers involved in the arrest will not be immediate . no reports will be made public , police commissioner @entity15 said , echoing an assertion he made last week that even after the prosecutors receive the files , the task force assigned to @entity5 's death will continue investigating . " that is just us sitting down , providing all the data we have . we will continue to follow the evidence wherever it goes , " @entity15 said . the @entity5 family 's legal team had no expectations otherwise . " i hate to say this , but i think if people are waiting for answers or charges to come , " attorney @entity30 said this week , " i do n't think that 's going to happen based on the way the process works , and i think that the government officials need to advise people of how the process honestly works and to lower their expectations about what 's going to happen . " mayor @entity42 seemed reluctant to do so during a thursday interview with @entity0 . pressed several times on whether answers would be forthcoming , the mayor seemed to dance around the question . handing over the report represents " an inflection point , " she said at first , before explaining that it also marks a " continuation in a process toward justice . " she went on to reiterate a point officials have made several times , that releasing information hastily could jeopardize the probe and any possible prosecution . asked again if it was fair for people to assume they would not get answers immediately , she said @entity2 officials had a " duty to protect the justice process . " prodded on whether the public should expect her or @entity15 to announce findings , she said she did n't want to " seek justice for optics " and explained she had spoken to schools , clergy and community leaders about what to expect . finally , asked flat out if people should expect an end to the saga when the report was handed over , she replied : " well , it ca n't be the end . there 's been no charges . there 's been no trial . it can not be the end .
