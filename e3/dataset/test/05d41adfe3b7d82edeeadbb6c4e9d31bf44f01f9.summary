( @entity1 ) she could stand on a strand of human hair , with room to spare . the microscopic polymer statue by @entity7 sculptor @entity6 , entitled @entity8 , measured just 1/100th of a centimeter and had been called the " smallest sculpture ever made . " but the world 's tiniest woman suddenly disappeared to an unknown location , likely never to be seen again . while she was being photographed through an electron microscope -- the only way to view the minute creation -- @entity8 vanished , with only a smudged fingerprint left behind by her photographer as a clue . after an hour long search , @entity6 and the photographer gave in : " it was horror . i remember saying to him : ' you just destroyed or lost the smallest human form that was ever created in history , ' said @entity6 to @entity27 to watch . " it was gone . " but was it , really ? @entity6 is an entrepreneur - turned - artist who has applied the same tech wizardry to sculpture that he put into coding a finance site valued at over $ 500 million . the 45 - year - old 's " nano - sculptures " are made from a mysterious resin -- " a big scientific secret " , says @entity6 -- and created through a process called " two - photon lithography . " @entity6 works with a team of nanotechnology engineers at @entity41 , who focus beams of ultraviolet light to " zap " solid the liquid resin , one @entity44 at a time . the resulting sculptures -- he has also created a statue depicting the classical myth of @entity49 and @entity50 -- can lie on an ant 's head . put one into the eye of a needle , and it will barely occupy one corner . the " @entity58 " project is just one of @entity6 ' science - inspired sculptural experiments . another one explores the properties of the mathematical constant pi , presenting an indecipherable , " anamorphic " physical sculpture , whose hidden form becomes clear only when reflected in a cylindrical mirror . and he hints that a forthcoming project will also be influenced by his love of the natural world , but will sit at the opposite end of the scale to his nano - models . @entity6 , who first made his name as the @entity76 - based co-founder of controversial " payday " loans business @entity77 , says he makes visual art with a team , as in traditionally collaborative art forms , such as cinema . he discusses accumulating collaborators as an aggressive start - up accumulates new talent : " i spent a huge amount of time scouring the world for amazing achievements of humanity and contact these people to work with them . for me the creation of an artwork these days is analogous to the creation of a film : for each piece there may 20 people involved , each one brilliant in their field . " @entity6 makes no secret of his desire to bring together contemporary science and art -- delighting in the fact that his nano - scale and @entity44 printed pieces depend on cutting edge technology , and would have been unimaginable just 10 years ago . online , fans response has been overwhelming , he says , and the internet has become his exhibition space . it provides an " epic scale " that brick - and - mortar galleries ca n't match , he says , and estimates 13 million people have seen his sculptures since they hit the web in november last year . " i love the buzz . i love the buzz when i launch a piece on the @entity121 and on @entity122 , you suddenly see society engaging ... millions and millions of people engaging .

" @entity6 says the creation of the physical artwork is " just the beginning of its lifecycle . " so what about the missing woman , whose lifecycle has tragically been cut short ? she came back to life during the filming of @entity27 to watch ( in the video above ) -- trust v.2 , her new name , has taken the absent dancer 's place . even still , there are some who think neither dancer was ever there . invisible to the naked eye , how can we trust this sculpture ever existed beyond the computer screen ? for @entity6 , this mystery gets right to the heart of nano - scale 's appeal : " you 've got this ' emperor 's new clothes ' element to this end of the scale spectrum , because you look at these nano - sculptures and there 's nothing there , there 's an element of me going : ' this sculpture ... believe me , it 's there . ' " at that scale , the sculpture does n't really exist , or our perception does n't allow us to perceive its existence .
