@entity4 , @entity5 ( @entity6 ) the call from @entity1 , the deputy chief of the provincial council , who we were supposed to be meeting up with , came just as we were about to hit the bridge -- the only safe route from @entity9 to neighboring @entity11 province . " @entity15 has taken the east of the city , it 's not accessible , " he says , sounding frantic , rapidly rattling off the neighborhoods and areas @entity15 fighters had just stormed into . moments later , we see the impact : an endless stream of humanity , shell shocked , and exhausted . parents cradle babies in blankets , some struggle under the weight of their belongings , some carry small plastic bags , while others nothing but the children clutching at their hands . cars are not permitted to cross this bridge across the @entity36 . the government feels that restricting vehicles will decrease the likelihood of explosives making their way into @entity5 's capital . those too young or too tired to walk pile into metal carts pushed by boys or young men , normally used to carry produce to markets . an elderly woman sits in one , a child in her arms , a worn down plastic doll in her hand . many do n't want to talk , at least not for long . what they just went through is too raw , too painful . one man we encounter describes how @entity15 fighters commandeered his house . " we heard clashes in the early morning , and we could n't see the security forces anywhere , " he recalls . " we saw the @entity15 fighters , they just came into the house , they did n't say a word . they just sent a sniper to the roof . i grabbed my children and ran . " his wife bursts into tears , prompting him to apologize for not being able to talk anymore -- they just want to keep going . another older woman , sitting in one of the carts surrounded by her grandchildren , starts sobbing the moment we approach her . " they took our homes and kicked us out , " she cries . over the weekend @entity15 moved into towns just to the north of @entity84 , which lies 68 miles ( 110km ) west of @entity9 , sending thousands fleeing on foot into the city . @entity15 had already blocked off access from the south months ago , and the west was contested territory . the east , until now , was not just a relatively safe zone but the only viable entrance and exit . at a hospital in @entity97 , about a 15 - minute drive away , a wounded local fighter winces in pain . he was shot by a sniper in @entity84 that morning as @entity15 fighters advanced -- the bullet barely missed his heart . " we had been warning we could see their movements , " he tells us . " but we just did n't have the force to hold them off . we did n't leave a single person we did n't call and ask for back up . " but none came . hours after our morning conversation we speak to @entity114 again by phone . " security is collapsing in the city , " he screams . " this is what we warned @entity9 would happen . where is @entity9 ? where is @entity123 ? " just @entity124 knows if we will survive this , " he says and hangs up . @entity126 regularly comes under attack from rockets and mortars from @entity15 positions nearby . the hospital 's façade is scarred by shrapnel . the wards are full of people injured during these attacks . fifteen - year - old @entity137 has bandages on his neck , leg , and other parts of his body . " a mortar fell on our street , one of my neighbors was wounded , " he explains . " we went out to help him and the second one fell on us . " his friend died , he says . in the next room @entity151 speaks softly . " i was in the garden and a rocket hit and the shrapnel sliced me open , " she says , as tears roll down her face . " something fell out of me and i grabbed it and i put it back in and i lay down . " she starts to cry harder . her husband was killed by @entity163 forces in @entity164 -- another city in @entity11 -- in 2003 . her children have all moved away except her youngest , who broke his arm in the same attack . " when i see the situation i do n't have hope , it 's just getting worse . " a few moments later , we hear two massive explosions from another of the hospital 's buildings . they think it 's an @entity15 rocket or mortar attack so we take cover along with the @entity5 forces we are with in the hallway , away from the windows . more explosions go off in the distance . then another actually shakes our building . " anyone want tea ? " one of the policemen with us asks , laughing as he pours . " this happens all the time , we 're used to it . " the police chief , @entity194 , radios to his men to respond . @entity197 , like so many others , is frustrated with the lack of support from @entity9 . earlier , he had taken us to the front lines , a long berm that stretches along the northern and western parts of the town that is dotted with fighting positions . he says he regularly provides the joint command center with coordinates for @entity15 positions , but so far there have been no significant air strikes or reinforcements . more explosions follow in the distance . we 're quickly moved out and leave the town , heading back towards the bridge and the long , snaking lines of refugees . an ambulance passes us , trying to force its way through the crowds . the swell of people fleeing has grown considerably in the last hours -- not surprising given @entity114 's dire assessment and warning . " @entity84 is under siege from all sides , " he 'd told us earlier , anger mixed with an air of resignation . " i consider the city to have fallen . " he claimed that 150,000 have fled , scoffing at statements from @entity5 officials in @entity9 that reinforcements have been sent to @entity84 . he has yet to see them .
