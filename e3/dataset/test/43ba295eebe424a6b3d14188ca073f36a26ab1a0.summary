@entity5 refugee camp , @entity2 ( @entity1 ) @entity0 and @entity3 emerge from their current home , a modest structure with plastic sheeting serving as its roof , carrying the " master folder*****1
" one of the most important documents on the camp , it 's a record of each @entity15 's name and their case -- whether they 've been granted refugee status , whether they 've had their resettlement interview , whether they 've attempted the journey to @entity24 by sea , and whether they 've survived it*****1
by the rows of names , red dots are marked to signify the dead*****0
in the past few days , news -- from the network of friends and family across the world -- came in that 20 new dots needed to be scratched in -- for the 20 friends who 'd drowned off the shores of @entity39*****1
for 25 years , @entity5 refugee camp has been a holding point for those fleeing into @entity2 , which borders @entity15 , @entity42 and @entity43 in the @entity44*****1
for the camp 's 10,000 residents , who mostly come from these countries , this is supposed to be just the first stop on their journey to resettlement through the @entity51*****0
many though say it 's been years and they 're tired of waiting*****0
for those willing to pay , there 's another route to a new life*****0
across the @entity42 border , through to @entity59 and then up and across into @entity60 -- from where the migrant ships operated by human traffickers set sail at high tide*****1
@entity0 's friend @entity67 was among the hundreds who lost their lives this week when their boat capsized in the @entity72 en route to @entity24 , he tells me*****0
they 'd grown up together -- even made the risky journey to @entity2 together*****1
when the time came for @entity67 to travel , @entity0 says he was asked to go too but said no. he hoped to give the legal route a little longer*****0
it was the first time they 'd been separated in years*****1
i ask @entity0 if he still believes in the legal route*****0

elected by the country 's national assembly in 1993 , @entity103 runs what is essentially a one - party state*****1
one young man at the camp comes over on crutches to show us his disfigured knee*****0
the commander of his military unit , he says , accused him of insubordination and with a viscous kick left him disabled for life -- just a few months shy of his 17th birthday*****0
he asks that we not reveal his name*****0
these are the things no one here will talk about on camera*****0
back in @entity2 we find a man who is willing to speak , as long as we obscure his identity*****0
with his face in shadow he haltingly tells us that the last time he saw his father was 20 years ago -- the night his mother was killed trying to stop the men who came to take him away*****1
he believes they were working for the security forces*****0
as soon as he was old enough , he says he made his first attempt at crossing into @entity2*****0

as soon as he 'd recovered though , he tried again , knowing that if he was caught this time he 'd be killed*****0
despite a wound that had barely healed , he made it into @entity2 after four days of walking day and night*****0
this is where he 's been for the last seven years , waiting to be resettled through the @entity51*****0
