( @entity2 ) @entity1 life seen swimming in unusual places*****1
water temperatures warmer than they should be*****1
no snow where there should be feet of it*****0
some scientists are saying " @entity12 " could be playing a factor*****0
as monikers go , the blob does n't sound very worrisome*****0
but if you 're a salmon fisherman in @entity16 or a @entity18 resident hoping to see the end of the drought , the blob could become an enemy of top concern*****0

@entity30 , who gave the blob its name , said it was 1,000 miles long , 1,000 miles wide and 100 yards deep in 2014 -- and it has grown this year*****0
and it 's not the only one ; there are two others that emerged in 2014 , @entity44 of the @entity45 -- part of the @entity47 ( @entity47 ) -- said in september*****0
one is in the @entity48 and the other is off the coast of @entity18*****0
waters in the blob have been warmer by about 5.5 degrees , a significant rise*****1

the numbers are overwhelming facilities that care for the stranded sea lions , most of whom are pups , local officials said*****0
record number of sea lion pups stranded in @entity18 the blob also is affecting life on land*****0
for the past few years , that persistent ridge of high pressure has kept the @entity59 dry and warm , exacerbating the drought in @entity18 , @entity138 and @entity16*****1
one of the primary problems is small snow accumulation in the mountains*****0
in early april , officials measured the snowpack in @entity18 at a time when it should be the highest*****0
this year it hit an all - time low at 1.4 inches of water content in the snow , just 5 % of the annual average*****1
the previous low for april 1 had been 25 % in 1977 and 2014*****0
( pdf ) gov. @entity153 , in announcing water restrictions the same day , stood on a patch of dry , brown grass in the @entity157 mountains that is usually blanketed by up to 5 feet of snow*****1
low @entity18 snowpack ushers mandatory water restrictions the heat has caused rising air , which can lead to conditions that produce more thunderstorms*****0
with warmer air in @entity18 , areas at higher elevations that usually see snow have seen rain instead*****1
that has led to the lower snowpack and helped compound the drought*****0
the storms also mean more lightning and more wildfires*****0
and the blob affects people on other areas of the country*****0
that same persistent jet stream pattern has allowed cold air to spill into much of the @entity182 and @entity183*****0
this stuck pattern has led to the record cold and snow in the @entity182 and @entity187 over the last two seasons with record snows we have seen in @entity191 and @entity192 , and the most snow we have seen in decades for cities such as @entity195*****0
the weather pattern is confusing the experts*****0
there are some that think it might be a @entity202 , a long - lasting @entity204 - like pattern in the @entity29*****0
@entity205 , a professor of atmospheric science at the @entity24 , does n't believe the answer is clear*****0
