@entity2 ( @entity1 ) chief justice @entity0 is back in the spotlight . @entity0 -- who shocked conservatives nearly three years ago by providing a pivotal vote to uphold @entity6 -- once again faces a judicial crossroads in a historic case . the @entity10 @entity9 will hear oral arguments tuesday in a case that could decide whether gay and lesbian couples nationwide have the constitutional right to marry . the question at the core of @entity18 v. @entity19 is one of the most consequential debates of the early 21st century , and one that is already helping to shape the 2016 presidential race . appeals courts nationwide have moved decisively toward supporting same - sex marriage , but a split at the appellate level helped propel the issue to the nation 's highest court , led by @entity0 . appointed to the bench by president @entity32 , @entity0 has a solid conservative record and would seem an unlikely vote to support a constitutional right to same - sex marriage . he dissented in @entity10 v. @entity37 , a landmark case in which a narrowly divided court struck down a key provision of the @entity42 , which denied federal benefits to lawfully married same - sex couples . and he 's expressed sympathy with legal arguments that would allow same - sex marriage bans . yet both sides see the case as a legacy - making moment for the 60 - year - old chief justice , and advocates for same - sex couples hold out hope that he will emerge as their ally . they will be scrutinizing his words and actions tuesday for clues about how he 'll vote -- and whether he will upset some conservatives once again . " if the @entity37 majority votes in favor of marriage equality , the ruling will be one of the most momentous decisions of the @entity0 court , " said @entity60 of the @entity61 , which is advocating for same - sex marriage . " @entity70 want to be remembered as having dissented from such a historic decision ? " for some conservatives , a vote in favor of same - sex marriage in the case would be a huge disappointment . it would be akin to the type of betrayal they felt when justice @entity82 , who was nominated to the bench by @entity84 and who retired in 2009 , consistently voted with the liberals or when justice @entity87 , a @entity88 appointee , disappointed them on earlier gay rights cases as well as abortion and the death penalty . or when @entity0 infuriated conservative allies by providing the crucial fifth vote to uphold @entity6 on the grounds that the law is a constitutional use of the government 's taxing authority . the hope in conservative circles is that @entity0 will see his legacy as ensuring that the issue of same - sex marriage gets decided by the people , not the courts .

@entity2 ( @entity1 ) chief justice @entity0 is back in the spotlight*****1
@entity0 -- who shocked conservatives nearly three years ago by providing a pivotal vote to uphold @entity6 -- once again faces a judicial crossroads in a historic case*****1
the @entity10 @entity9 will hear oral arguments tuesday in a case that could decide whether gay and lesbian couples nationwide have the constitutional right to marry*****1
the question at the core of @entity18 v. @entity19 is one of the most consequential debates of the early 21st century , and one that is already helping to shape the 2016 presidential race*****0
appeals courts nationwide have moved decisively toward supporting same - sex marriage , but a split at the appellate level helped propel the issue to the nation 's highest court , led by @entity0*****1
appointed to the bench by president @entity32 , @entity0 has a solid conservative record and would seem an unlikely vote to support a constitutional right to same - sex marriage*****1
he dissented in @entity10 v. @entity37 , a landmark case in which a narrowly divided court struck down a key provision of the @entity42 , which denied federal benefits to lawfully married same - sex couples*****1
and he 's expressed sympathy with legal arguments that would allow same - sex marriage bans*****1
yet both sides see the case as a legacy - making moment for the 60 - year - old chief justice , and advocates for same - sex couples hold out hope that he will emerge as their ally*****1
they will be scrutinizing his words and actions tuesday for clues about how he 'll vote -- and whether he will upset some conservatives once again*****0

or when @entity0 infuriated conservative allies by providing the crucial fifth vote to uphold @entity6 on the grounds that the law is a constitutional use of the government 's taxing authority*****1
the hope in conservative circles is that @entity0 will see his legacy as ensuring that the issue of same - sex marriage gets decided by the people , not the courts*****1

the @entity42 decision overshadowed another 2013 case -- @entity229 -- that could have determined whether states could ban same - sex marriage*****1
the case concerned a challenge to @entity235 's @entity234 , a state constitutional amendment that barred same - sex couples from marriage*****1
but @entity0 , writing for the majority , dismissed the case , holding that the challengers did not have the legal standing to bring it to the court*****1
the ruling left in place a lower court decision that had invalidated @entity234 and thus paved the way for same - sex marriage in @entity235*****1
@entity0 ' lesbian cousin , who lives in @entity235 , sat in the courtroom during arguments in the @entity234 case*****1
few people predicted that the issue would return so quickly to the @entity9 , but waves of lower court judges -- sometimes citing @entity37 -- struck down the state bans*****0
on the first day of the term last fall , the court was presented with seven different petitions on the issue*****0
conventional wisdom was that the justices would garner the four necessary votes and grant one of the cases*****0
but conventional wisdom was completely wrong*****0
without comment , the court declined to take up any of the cases , clearing the way for thousands of additional same - sex marriages*****1
the court 's vote count in such decisions is kept a secret and may never be known*****0
but some speculate on one possible scenario : @entity0 chose not to provide the fourth vote to the conservatives who dissented in @entity37*****1
then again , even if the speculation were true , it does n't reveal much about @entity0 ' thinking*****0
there 's a big difference between voting not to take up a case , which expresses no opinions on the merits , and issuing an opinion on the merits*****0
and even when @entity0 ' actions -- such as effectively allowing same - sex marriage to proceed in @entity235 -- seem to suggest a willingness to consider such unions nationwide , his comments along the way make it much harder to gain insight into his ultimate thinking*****1
