( @entity1 ) these are fearful times on the highest mountain in the world . the devastating earthquake that hit @entity6 on saturday set off avalanches that left large numbers of climbers dead , missing , injured or trapped on @entity10 . and aftershocks , including a strong one sunday , are continuing to send snow and rocks thundering down the mountainside , complicating rescue efforts . " we were sitting here in base camp , feeling the situation was getting better , " said climber @entity16 . " and then suddenly , we felt the aftershock , " he told @entity1 on sunday . " and immediately after the shock , we hear avalanches from all the mountains around us . " but those avalanches did n't appear to be on the same scale as those that came roaring down on the camp saturday . the base camp on the @entity6 side of @entity10 is in a vulnerable spot , sitting in a valley surrounded by high @entity35 peaks . when the huge , lengthy quake struck saturday , the scores of climbers who had gathered there to prepare for or recover from ascents of the peak had nowhere to run . " an earthquake that long set off avalanches all the way around us . and they came down -- they were large , they were massive avalanches , " said @entity47 , an @entity48 mountaineer at the base camp . people tried to flee as the onrushing wall of snow , ice and rocks took out large sections of the camp . " they were trying to outrun the avalanche and you can not , " said @entity16 . " so many people were hit from behind , blown off the mountain , blown into rocks , hit by debris , tents were flying off . " he said he took shelter behind a large pile of stones . " i could hardly breathe , but i could stay until the avalanche was over , " he told @entity1 . a huge cloud of snow dust billowed hundreds of feet into the sky . " we all ducked for cover until the cloud passed and then started dealing with the aftermath , " @entity47 said . that included at least 17 people killed , dozens injured and many others missing , he said . they are one part of the enormous human toll in @entity6 and beyond from the catastrophic quake . the many unhurt people at the camp scrambled to help the injured , digging them out of the snow and turning dining tents into makeshift field hospitals . @entity92 that continued to fall made it hard for them to see , hampering their efforts . climbers worked in shifts through the night , nursing the injured as they waited for the weather conditions to improve to allow helicopters in . " a lot of them are in pretty tough shape , " @entity47 said of the injured . the airlifts of those with the most severe injuries began sunday morning after the weather cleared . " the sun is breaking through the clouds , and the choppers are coming in , " @entity47 said . " we 're pretty grateful . we 're going to get these guys down the hill . " @entity16 said that most of the injured people at the base camp had been airlifted out by sunday afternoon . but concerns were growing for the groups of climbers stuck farther up the 29,035 - foot ( 8,848 - meter ) mountain in @entity119 and 2 . the avalanche was reported to have trapped them above the icefall area , an already treacherous part of the mountain that separates the base camp from @entity126 . " they 'll have to put a new route in from base camp up through that icefall , " said @entity127 , the first @entity48 to reach the summit of @entity10 . the climbers " will have to cool it for a couple days , wait until the route is re-established , " he told @entity1 . but the frequent aftershocks were making that task more difficult . @entity136 , a mountaineer at the base camp , said sunday on @entity138 that ropes and other gear were being helicoptered to the people trapped above the icefall . a few of the climbers were taken down by helicopter , but more than 100 were believed to still be up there , he wrote . " practically , it 's impossible to get them off with helicopters , " @entity16 said . " there are so many people up there . " amid the struggle to save the living , details started to emerge about some of the dead . among them was @entity159 , an @entity48 executive at @entity160 who had been posting updates about his adventures in @entity6 on @entity164 and @entity138 . his sister , @entity165 , updated the @entity164 account with a message saying he suffered a major head injury . " we appreciate all of the love that has been sent our way thus far and know his soul and his spirit will live on in so many of us , " she wrote . " all our love and thanks to those who shared this life with our favorite hilarious strong willed man . he was and is everything to us . " @entity184 , a medic from @entity185 who worked on the mountain , was also killed , according to her family and employer . " on behalf of my family , it is with deep sadness that i write that our beloved daughter , younger sister and best friend has been taken from us today , " a family member wrote on @entity190 . " @entity197 was doing the thing she loved doing most -- helping others . words can not describe the heartbreak and pain that we are currently suffering . " people at the base camp described a grim , chaotic situation after the avalanches saturday . " it 's a pretty rough scene up here , " @entity47 said . he told @entity1 that he 'd put one dead man inside a sleeping bag and zipped it up . many of those who suffered the worst injuries were asked to write down their names to identify them in case they died , @entity47 said . the exact number of dead remained unclear . @entity47 reported 17 ; @entity220 , a doctor with an expedition at the base camp told @entity1 that he had seen 14 bodies so far . but an unknown number of people are still missing , buried beneath the snow and ice . the earthquake struck just over a year after an avalanche on @entity10 killed 16 sherpas , the deadliest single disaster on the mountain up to that point . the @entity234 , an ethnic group , are famed for their climbing skills and often work as mountain guides . " this is our job , " said @entity237 , who lost people close to him in the 2014 avalanche . " so there is always a risk of death . " @entity47 was also there last year when that avalanche came crashing down the icefall . he described to @entity1 at the time the harrowing experience of seeing bodies being removed . the @entity48 climber has scaled all of the " @entity251 , " the highest mountain on each of the seven continents , except @entity10 . this is his third straight year trying to scale the tallest peak of them all . he turned back in 2013 " because it did n't feel right , " according to his wife , @entity258 . will @entity47 try again after witnessing another disaster on the mountain ? " you would think that he would n't because of this and because of last year , " @entity263 said from her @entity265 home . " but knowing my husband i think he will . i hope not , but i do n't want to hold him back . " @entity1 's @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 and @entity272 contributed to this report .
