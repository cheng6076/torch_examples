( @entity1 ) the marriage apocalypse may be coming . talk to any millennial and you can envision an @entity4 virtually marriage - free , with everyone happily single . i did . and i do . recently , i talked about marriage with a group of journalism students from my alma mater , @entity10 . they came to me for career advice , which i gave them , but i also picked their brains about politics , religion and marriage . their views on marriage intrigued me the most . ' @entity21 , guess what ? they do n't care what your generation thinks -- they 'll get married if and when they want . " i did n't go to college for four years to be a mom , " 21 - year old @entity29 told me . " there 's no housewife degree . i 've worked my butt off for four years to get this degree . you want to use it . you want to be successful . you want to have that happy part of your life as well . " @entity40 , also 21 , agreed . " i would have a very hard time justifying spending $ 20,000 on a wedding when i could go to @entity43 . " at first i thought @entity40 was kidding . so jokingly , i responded , " wow , some people would say , with that attitude , you are undermining the moral foundation of this country ! " @entity40 did n't blink . " but , @entity43 ! " she exclaimed . " i 'm really looking for a travel buddy . and i do n't think you need a wedding ring to prove that you love someone . i see a lot of people get married too soon or stay together and are unhappy because they are afraid to be alone . and i would rather be alone , successful and happy than in a relationship where i 'm not happy . ... i 'm ok being single forever . as long as i 'm happy . " before you berate @entity40 for prioritizing her love of travel over marriage , consider where she 's coming from . a culture rich in divorce . in the @entity4 , almost 42 million adults have been married more than once . that 's up from 22 million in 1980 and 14 million in 1960 . percentage-wise , that means that among adults who are currently married , roughly a quarter ( 23 % ) have been married before , compared with 13 % in 1960 . what a fine example my generation is ! not . still , there are no doubt more than a few parents out there wondering where they went wrong . especially in light of a fascinating @entity74 report on marriage . when asked if society is just as well off if people have priorities other than marriage and children , 50 % of respondents were ok with that . and of that 50 % , 66 % were adults between 18 and 29 . religious leaders are deeply concerned for moral reasons . economists are concerned for our collective future . studies show marriage is correlated with economic well - being , though it is not clear whether the causality arrow goes from marriage toward economic benefit or in the other direction . a study sponsored by the conservative @entity97 says : " from an obvious standpoint , households with two adults are likelier to have two incomes , improving well - being .

religious leaders are deeply concerned for moral reasons*****0
