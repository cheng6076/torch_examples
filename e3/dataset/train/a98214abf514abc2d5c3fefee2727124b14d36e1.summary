put another way : " they are horrible*****0
they are demeaning*****0
they are belittling*****0
they are disempowering , " said @entity30 of @entity31 , @entity32 hospital gowns have gotten a face - lift after some help from fashion designers like these from @entity39 and the @entity40*****1
the gowns are among the most vexing parts of being in the hospital*****0
but if efforts by some health systems are an indicator , the design may be on its way out of style*****0
the @entity50 was an early trendsetter*****0
in 2010 , it introduced new gowns after being prompted by the ceo , who often heard patient complaints when he was a practicing heart surgeon*****0
that feedback led to a search for something new , said @entity60 , chief experience officer at the hospital system*****0
the prominent academic medical center ultimately sought the help of fashion icon @entity64 , settling on a reversible gown with a front and back v - neck , complete derriere coverage , and features such as pockets , softer fabric and a new bolder print pattern*****1

ultimately , this focus leads to " a better patient experience , " said @entity113 , senior vice president of the @entity114*****0
the @entity116 - based @entity115 is in the process of updating its gowns , an initiative that began when the system 's innovation institute challenged students at the city 's @entity123 to identify and offer a solution to one hospital problem*****1
the students responded with the suggestion to redo the garment that has often been described by patients as flimsy , humiliating , indecent and itchy*****0
the process took three years , but last fall , the institute unveiled a new and improved version*****0
it 's made of warmer fabric -- a cotton blend -- that wraps around a patient 's body like a robe and comes in navy and light blue , the hospital 's signature colors*****0

after @entity182 of @entity183 , @entity184 , switched to pajamas and gowns that provide extra coverage , costs went up $ 70,000 per year , said @entity188 , the facility 's chief supply chain officer , because the new garments cost more to buy and maintain*****0
beyond cost , more ingrained cultural expectations might also play a role in what hospitals think patients should wear , said @entity198 , an assistant professor of medicine at @entity200 , who co-authored a 2014 study in the journal @entity203 , examining whether gowns were important and whether patients might be fine wearing their own or hospital - provided pants , instead of or along with gowns*****1
often , doctors reported that pants or undergarments beneath gowns would have been okay , but patients said they were never given those options*****1
traditional gowns make it easier to examine patients quickly , and several doctors @entity198 spoke to seemed shocked at the idea that patients might wear garments other than the open - backed gown during their stay*****1
