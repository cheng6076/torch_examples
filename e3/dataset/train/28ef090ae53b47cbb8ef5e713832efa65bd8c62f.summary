( @entity0 ) five young @entity2 feminists , whose detention has provoked an international outcry , may face up to five years in prison over their campaign for gender equality . the women were among detained on march 6 and march 7 in three @entity2 cities -- @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 -- shortly before events they had planned for @entity15 on march 8 . @entity16 , the lawyer for one of the women , @entity17 , said police had recommended on april 6 that prosecutors press charges of " assembling a crowd to disturb public order . " @entity16 told @entity0 that prosecutors had to decide whether to pursue the charges within seven days of the submission -- by monday . " we hope that the prosecutors will not approve a formal arrest warrant , following the laws and standing up to pressure , " he said . " but nobody knows what to expect till monday ; we can do nothing but wait . " the five were initially held on suspicion of " picking quarrels and provoking trouble . " @entity16 said he did n't know why the charge against the women changed . " neither should constitute a crime , " he said . campaign group @entity41 said the new charge was less serious but still carried a maximum jail term of five years . " the women were doing nothing wrong , nothing illegal . they were simply calling for an end to sexual harassment , " @entity47 , @entity2 researcher at @entity41 told @entity0 . " everything they were doing was in line with @entity2 's own laws and policies . " @entity16 said that @entity17 had been subject to lengthy cross examinations during her detention but was well the last time they met on march 31 . two of the women are said to be in poor health . he added that the charges relate both to the activities the women planned for @entity15 and earlier campaigns against domestic violence and for more public toilets for women . the five -- who are members of @entity2 's @entity70 -- had planned to hand out stickers printed with slogans saying " stop sexual harassment , let us stay safe " and " go police , go arrest those who committed sexual harassment ! " on women 's day . the detention of @entity17 , along with @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 has drawn harsh criticism from the international community . protests have taken place in several cities , including @entity88 , that urge @entity2 officials to " free the five . " a social media campaign also uses the phrase as a hashtag . on monday , @entity94 , former @entity95 secretary of state , tweeted that the activists ' detention was " inexcusable . " her comment drew a rebuke from @entity2 authorities , who said public figures should respect @entity2 's sovereignty and independence . @entity105 , @entity2 researcher at @entity106 , said the activists were best known for their " performance art " style protests -- occupying public toilets to highlight long lines at women 's restrooms , donning blood - spattered wedding gowns to protest domestic violence and shaving their heads to protest against barriers to higher education for women . " these activists epitomize the spirit of the times . they are young , confident , ready to challenge established norms , " @entity16 said . as @entity2 prepares to mark the anniversary of landmark @entity126 in september , it will be hard for authorities to justify detaining the activists , she added .
