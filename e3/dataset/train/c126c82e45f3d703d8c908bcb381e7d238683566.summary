( @entity2 ) on the surface , the mix - up seems incomprehensible : how can a volunteer sheriff 's deputy accidentally fire a handgun instead of a @entity6 , killing a man ? that 's apparently what happened in @entity10 , @entity11 , when a 73 - year - old reserve deputy , @entity12 , killed @entity13 . @entity12 said he meant to use his stun gun but ended up firing his handgun instead . " oh ! i shot him . i 'm sorry , " @entity12 said in a video of the shooting . but it 's happened before . in a well - publicized 2009 case , a @entity21 police officer fired his gun instead of his taser , killing 22 - year - old @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 . the former officer , @entity25 , testified that he had meant to use his taser but drew his gun instead . @entity30 was sentenced to two years in prison for involuntary manslaughter but was released early due to good conduct . so how easy -- or hard -- is it to draw and fire a handgun mistakenly instead of a @entity6 ? here are some factors to consider : law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer 's dominant side of the body , and the taser should be placed on the nondominant side . so if an officer is left - handed , the gun should be on the left side . @entity12 ' attorney said his client is left - handed . but the reserve deputy said his gun was holstered on his right side -- his nondominanant side . " i shoot long guns left handed and handguns right handed , " @entity12 said in a written statement to investigators . after @entity12 announced at the scene he was going to use his taser , he " used his nondominant hand , and it was the gun , " said @entity56 , @entity12 ' attorney . " he said that he saw the laser sight on the shoulder , assumed it was the @entity6 , " @entity56 said . " both the gun and the @entity6 have a laser sight , and he just made a mistake . " @entity56 also said his client 's left hand was holding a pepper gun . in his statement to investigators , @entity12 said he had grabbed a " pepper ball launcher " to try to slow or stop @entity13 , who was running away . @entity12 did not say explicitly where the @entity6 was on his body . but he admitted to grabbing the wrong device and said he was " startled " by the recoil of the gun . " after realizing what had happened i was in a state of shock and disbelief , " he told investigators . @entity12 is now charged with second - degree manslaughter . if convicted , he faces up to four years in prison . deputy who shot @entity13 turns himself in @entity12 was carrying his personal gun , a @entity86 .357 five - shot revolver , and a @entity6 , he said in his statement to investigators . attorneys representing the @entity13 family said there are stark differences between the two devices . one held up a small black .357 revolver , followed by a mostly bright yellow taser that was noticeably larger than the gun .

( @entity2 ) on the surface , the mix - up seems incomprehensible : how can a volunteer sheriff 's deputy accidentally fire a handgun instead of a @entity6 , killing a man ? that 's apparently what happened in @entity10 , @entity11 , when a 73 - year - old reserve deputy , @entity12 , killed @entity13*****1
@entity12 said he meant to use his stun gun but ended up firing his handgun instead*****1
" oh ! i shot him*****0
i 'm sorry , " @entity12 said in a video of the shooting*****0
but it 's happened before*****0
in a well - publicized 2009 case , a @entity21 police officer fired his gun instead of his taser , killing 22 - year - old @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27*****1
the former officer , @entity25 , testified that he had meant to use his taser but drew his gun instead*****1
@entity30 was sentenced to two years in prison for involuntary manslaughter but was released early due to good conduct*****0
so how easy -- or hard -- is it to draw and fire a handgun mistakenly instead of a @entity6 ? here are some factors to consider : law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer 's dominant side of the body , and the taser should be placed on the nondominant side*****1
so if an officer is left - handed , the gun should be on the left side*****1
@entity12 ' attorney said his client is left - handed*****0
but the reserve deputy said his gun was holstered on his right side -- his nondominanant side*****0
" i shoot long guns left handed and handguns right handed , " @entity12 said in a written statement to investigators*****0
after @entity12 announced at the scene he was going to use his taser , he " used his nondominant hand , and it was the gun , " said @entity56 , @entity12 ' attorney*****1
" he said that he saw the laser sight on the shoulder , assumed it was the @entity6 , " @entity56 said*****1
" both the gun and the @entity6 have a laser sight , and he just made a mistake*****1
" @entity56 also said his client 's left hand was holding a pepper gun*****0
in his statement to investigators , @entity12 said he had grabbed a " pepper ball launcher " to try to slow or stop @entity13 , who was running away*****1
@entity12 did not say explicitly where the @entity6 was on his body*****1
but he admitted to grabbing the wrong device and said he was " startled " by the recoil of the gun*****0
" after realizing what had happened i was in a state of shock and disbelief , " he told investigators*****0
@entity12 is now charged with second - degree manslaughter*****0
if convicted , he faces up to four years in prison*****0
deputy who shot @entity13 turns himself in @entity12 was carrying his personal gun , a @entity86 .357 five - shot revolver , and a @entity6 , he said in his statement to investigators*****1
attorneys representing the @entity13 family said there are stark differences between the two devices*****1
one held up a small black .357 revolver , followed by a mostly bright yellow taser that was noticeably larger than the gun*****0
" there 's no way an officer can get this confused with this , " said one of the attorneys from the law firm of @entity101 , @entity102 & @entity103*****0
@entity111 's @entity110 model comes in different designs*****0
some are mostly yellow , while others are mostly black with a yellow panel in the middle*****0
but all appear to be larger than @entity86 .357 five - shot revolvers*****0
sgt. @entity119 of the @entity120 -- which is separate from the county sheriff 's office for which @entity12 volunteered -- said @entity12 was the " victim " of something called " slip and capture*****0
" that 's when a person intends to do one thing but instead does another in a high - stress situation*****0

" the only time slip and capture has ever been used as a defense was in the shooting in @entity26 ( of @entity25 ) , " the attorney said*****0
and that defense failed*****0
tasers are built to feel and look different than guns , according to @entity158*****0
@entity159 , vice president for strategic communications at @entity6 , noted some of those differences to @entity2 : a gun is heavier*****1
a taser has a different grip and feel*****0
when you take the safety off on a @entity6 , an led control panel lights up*****0
there 's more : tasers can be different colors ( yellow or black ) , and the holster is different from a gun 's*****0
but in the field , where an officer reacts on instinct , there are other distinctions outside of the product itself that are important , @entity159 said*****0
@entity111 's training calls for the stun gun to be placed on an officer 's nondominant side , as law enforcement experts say*****1
and its training suggests that officers shout aloud , " @entity6 ! taser ! taser ! " as they prepare to deploy it*****0
these guidelines are designed so that in the moment -- when an officer 's muscle memory kicks in -- the body reflexively knows which weapon it is reaching for*****0
it is up to each law enforcement department , however , in how it trains personnel and what regulations it requires as far as placement on the body*****0
the company declined to comment on the @entity10 shooting in particular*****0
the stun guns , or conducted electrical weapons , manufactured by @entity6 have been used more than 2.7 million times , @entity159 said , and are designed to be used in situations that are not considered life or death*****0
