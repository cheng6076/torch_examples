" the change will come , " he said , bringing to the crowd to its feet . the head of the church , @entity58 , spoke of how @entity6 had brought members of his family to the church , of the agony of not only losing a family member but having to watch it happen on video . the death of @entity6 , who was black , at the hands of a white police officer was " motivated by racial prejudice , " @entity58 said . it was " an act of overt racism . " " @entity73 came because @entity6 was an @entity74 , " he said . @entity58 said his remarks were not meant as an indictment of law enforcement , but he singled out the officer who killed @entity6 as a " disgrace to the @entity80 . " " there is gong to be change , " he said . " @entity6 's death will not be in vain . " after the service , pallbearers gently lifted @entity6 's casket into the hearse . crowds poured from the church . a slow - moving procession of black cars then made its way to @entity94 in @entity0 for the private burial . @entity96 , an attorney for the @entity6 family , said the death represented more than an race issue . " it 's a human issue , " he said . " we 're getting emails from people in @entity104 telling us , ' i 'm a white male , and i 'm supporting this family . ' their son is going to be remembered for changing the way we look at each other . " on friday night , @entity6 's open casket was draped with an @entity13 flag , and he was in a dark suit for his private visitation in @entity0 . a @entity115 banner -- his favorite @entity117 team -- was placed outside the casket , and a figurine of a @entity115 player stood at his side . but @entity6 's family was missing . they needed privacy , said @entity0 mayor @entity125 , who attended . a week ago , @entity6 was killed in @entity126 after getting pulled over for a broken taillight . a passer - by caught the shooting on cell phone video , and officer @entity131 was swiftly charged with murder . he was fired and faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted . who was @entity6 ? the video shows @entity6 running from an officer , who fires eight shots . @entity6 is struck five times ; he falls to the ground . " nothing in this video demonstrates that the officer 's life or the life of another was threatened , " @entity143 president @entity142 said . " the question here is whether the use of force was excessive .

' " @entity158 ' account has similarities to @entity131 's . he had told investigators that he had tussled with @entity50 over his taser and that he feared for his safety . a timeline of events criminal defense attorney @entity178 said he believes @entity131 's defense will play up the reported scuffle in arguing that this is not a murder case . " defense attorneys will say this was a heat of passion shooting -- ( that ) this was something that he did suddenly after some kind of an altercation , a physical altercation with a suspect , " @entity178 said . " and that would constitute manslaughter under law , as opposed to murder , and it makes a huge difference in sentencing . " in @entity1 , a murder conviction requires a measure of premeditation . but the account from the witness who recorded the cell phone video , @entity203 , paints a different picture . he was walking to work when he saw @entity131 on top of @entity6 , he said , who was on the ground . @entity203 said he could hear the sound of a taser in use . he said he did n't see @entity6 go after the @entity211 , as @entity131 initially claimed . he said he believes @entity6 was trying to get away .

" the cell phone video shot by a bystander confirmed our initial suspicions . " @entity131 's lawyer , @entity233 , has complained that he " has not received the cooperation from law enforcement that the media has . " @entity233 's office said in a statement that it has yet to receive " any investigative documents , audio or video tapes , other than a copy of mr. @entity131 's arrest warrant .

" a second video , taken from a police dash cam , has also emerged from the day @entity6 died . it shows moments before the shooting , when things seemed to be going smoothly between @entity6 and @entity131 . @entity6 apparently tells the officer that he has no insurance on the vehicle , and @entity131 returns to his car to do paperwork . then @entity6 gets out of the car and runs out of the camera 's frame . @entity6 was the subject of a bench warrant over $ 18,104.43 in unpaid child support at the time of the stop , according to court records . that was why he ran , lawyers for the family said after the funeral service . @entity13 rep. @entity305 , @entity306 - @entity1 , told reporters outside the service that @entity6 lost a $ 35,000 - a - year job the first time he was jailed for failing to pay child support . " he said it was the best job he 's ever had , " @entity305 said . " now you have to ask ... if you want to collect child support , there 's got to be income . and you ai n't going to make much income from jail . it seems to me that we need to take a look to how to deal with that issue without causing unemployment and the loss of freedom . " on friday afternoon , police met with a man who was in @entity6 's car , but the passenger 's name was n't in a police report obtained by @entity2 . he was detained briefly after the shooting , one officer wrote in the report . @entity6 family attorney @entity96 said he was a co-worker and friend . but he did not identify the passenger by name . on friday , a few mourners trickled into the @entity338 for funerals . a white banner with a blue star near @entity6 's casket displayed his favorite @entity117 team . it said : " tradition , the @entity115 way .
