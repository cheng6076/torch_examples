( @entity9 ) in the hours after the funeral of @entity1 , a community center and apartment complex that local leaders expected to serve as a catalyst for the rebuilding of a long blighted @entity8 neighborhood went up in flames . the $ 16 million @entity11 was being built in a part of town where half the properties are vacant buildings or barren lots , where unemployment rates reach 25 % and poverty and despair is rampant . " disheartened and bewildered " was how the rev. @entity20 , pastor of @entity8 's @entity21 , described feeling tuesday as he surveyed the still - smoldering ruins of the centerpiece of a community rebuilding effort led by his church and a coalition of other congregations . " i see the hopelessness ... and the emotions of the people but i still see hope in @entity33 that we can rise from the ashes , " he said . " we can rebuild . this can not be the legacy of @entity8 . " the project was to include about 60 senior citizen apartments and a community center . in the works for eight years , the center was to provide behavioral health counseling , support services for people and families with @entity47 and @entity48 , employment training , home and credit counseling , and ex-offender re-entry services , according to documents filed with the state of @entity55 . the cause of the blaze was still under investigation . the brick building burned to the ground in the riots that followed monday 's funeral for @entity1 , who died mysteriously on april 19 , a week after @entity8 police arrested him . anger over @entity1 's death may have spurred monday 's violence -- including buildings and cars set ablaze by rioters , looting and clashes with the police -- but members of @entity8 's clergy said it was also spurred by lasting issues with young african - americans in the city . " we 've been trying to make a major difference , trying to transform the community only to discover that something as tragic as this would take place , " said the rev. @entity76 , pastor of @entity77 -- part of the @entity80 's @entity79 . " we saw it coming , " he added . " @entity8 is a tinderbox . we have a lot of anger as a result of unemployment . we have a high rate of incarceration . " high concentrations of poverty , underfunded and failing schools , neglected public housing projects and a lack of employment opportunities have been among the social issues long simmering below @entity8 's crumbling row houses , according to the local church leaders . " i think the reason that they burned it is exactly the reason why we needed it , " @entity20 said of the community center . " we were seeking to restore people while we rebuilt properties . we wanted to effect change in the human community as well as rebuild properties with affordable housing . " the rev. @entity113 , pastor of @entity114 and member of the coalition , said parts of @entity8 have not recovered from the 1968 riots that followed the assassination of the rev. @entity120 those riots sped up the flight of city residents to the suburbs . unemployment soared with the disappearance of blue - collar jobs . the drug scourge in the 1980s tore the community apart further .
