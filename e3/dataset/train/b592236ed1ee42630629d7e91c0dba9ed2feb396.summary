( @entity2 ) @entity1 's president on friday hailed the proposed international deal on his country 's nuclear program , vowing that @entity1 will stick to its promises and -- assuming other countries live up to their end of the bargain -- become a more active , engaged player in world affairs . " some think that we should either fight ... or we should surrender to other powers , " president @entity13 said . " however , we believe none of that . there is a third path . we can cooperate with the world . " @entity13 said his government kept its word to @entity1 when negotiating the framework deal , which was agreed upon thursday and sets parameters for talks that could lead to a comprehensive deal by a june 30 deadline . chief among them is that @entity1 would keep at least some centrifuges and no longer face international sanctions . he thanked @entity1 for their patience and for " resisting " by standing up for the country 's rights . as to the rest of the world , the @entity1 president said he thinks most now realize that @entity1 " is pursuing peaceful objectives . " that means trying to develop nuclear energy , not nuclear weapons , as many feared . that fear , combined with distrust of @entity1 's leaders , spurred the sanctions and the @entity49 nation 's isolation . " we do not lie , " @entity13 said , vowing that @entity1 will be true to its word , " provided the other parties will implement their own promises . " what @entity1 think of the deal those promises include reducing @entity1 's stockpile of low - enriched uranium by 98 % for 15 years and significantly scaling back its number of installed centrifuges . still , while it will be shrunken and centralized , @entity1 's nuclear program wo n't go away . what should happen -- assuming there 's a common view that @entity64 is doing as required -- is that countries will end their sanctions . that was non-negotiable for @entity1 , with @entity13 saying the deal shows his government 's commitment to removing a major " obstacle ... for business " by addressing the world 's worries about its nuclear program . " we need economic productivity , employment for the youth and development of non-oil products , " he said . " thus our people can witness better things for their welfare . " it wo n't be easy , of course , to get @entity1 and the @entity87 -- the @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 -- on the same page regarding the nitty - gritty details of any final agreement , if there is one . after all , it took two extra days past a self - imposed deadline for the parties to reach a framework deal . what 's in the deal ? 7 key points that agreement followed about a decade of often failed negotiations and deep - rooted acrimony , particularly between @entity1 and the @entity88 . those tensions have n't disappeared , nor is there any guarantee that talks wo n't fall apart again over the next three months . even as he applauded what he called a " good deal , " president @entity113 pointed out thursday that " if @entity1 cheats , the world will know it . " his government is also being pressed by @entity120 prime minister @entity119 , who blasted the agreement friday as posing a " grave danger " by legitimizing @entity1 's nuclear program and making it easier for @entity1 to develop nuclear weapons . on the @entity1 side , foreign minister @entity126 has acknowledged that " mutual mistrust " has long plagued talks . he notes @entity1 still has " serious differences with the @entity88 , " even after thursday 's agreement . still , @entity13 expressed hopes friday the nuclear negotiations will change that by further opening up @entity1 to the rest of world , including long - standing adversaries . " we do shake hands with them . ... even those countries we have tensions with , we would like an end to the animosity , " he said .
