( @entity1 ) much like the ardent young royal - watchers of today , enamored by the @entity3 's very being , i was similarly captivated by @entity4 when i was a youngster . she was a rare breed : stunningly beautiful , immediately accessible , witty , charming and endearingly mischievous -- she was one in a million . of course that was long before the , " there were three of us in this marriage , so it was a bit crowded , " interviews and tell - all books alleging suicide attempts and acts of betrayal , but back then i was unaware of her more scandalous infamy . i simply adored her ... i still do . as the world awaits the impending birth of @entity23 and @entity3 's second baby , potential names have become the topic of rampant speculation and heated debate . girls ' names are causing the biggest stir , as there seems to be a belief that the couple are expecting a princess . if the assumptions are correct , she will be the first princess of @entity37 born into the royal family in 182 years . the birth of any baby is cause for celebration , but given recent changes in the laws of succession , her arrival would be a historical one . in choosing a name , titled royals tend to turn to the family tree , rather than a well - thumbed copy of " @entity51 " like the rest of us . traditionally they pick dynastic names , and there are plenty to choose from : @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 have all been frontrunners , but the sentimental favorite among punters remains @entity4 . in a recent @entity66 poll , 32 % of @entity64 predicted the name was a shoo - in , and in the @entity68 the bookies ' odds of a baby named after her late grandmother change almost daily as @entity4 becomes an increasingly popular choice . that said , in the event the couple do welcome a baby girl , i would hope that they do not opt to name her @entity4 . today @entity4 's name is as divisive as the very institution of monarchy itself : while some have virtually sainted her , others have been vehemently critical , accusing her of being childish , unhinged and self - serving . contrary to popular belief the @entity87 was very fond of @entity4 , but should her name be bestowed as a first name upon the baby , it would be perceived as a slap in the face to the monarchy . in the years since @entity95 's scathing attack on the @entity96 at @entity4 's funeral , the nation has moved on and @entity4 's legacy has been celebrated . she has become a part of royal history . her memory has been preserved , and the royal family is once again enjoying a renewed sense of popularity . out of respect to the @entity87 , @entity107 , @entity108 and the baby herself the couple simply would n't do it . @entity4 's name conjures up both positive and negative responses the world over , and whichever side of the fence you 're on , the moniker seems to me an almighty burden for a newborn baby to carry . since @entity4 's death almost 18 years ago , @entity23 has honored his mother 's memory in a private and personal fashion . he has taken on many of her patronages and continued to champion her causes . at his wedding in 2011 the @entity128 , @entity129 , a close friend of @entity4 and executor of her will , gave the address . the hymn @entity134 , which was sung at both @entity4 's funeral in 1997 and at the memorial marking the tenth anniversary of her death in 2007 , was chosen for the royal wedding . @entity141 , another close friend of @entity4 , was asked to serve as godmother to @entity143 . @entity23 chose @entity144 , his own childhood home , to be the primary residence for his family , and in perhaps the most public acknowledgment of his mother 's memory , he gave @entity151 's engagement ring . @entity23 does n't need to name his second - born child after his mother in order to honour her ; he does so by being a good husband and father . i still miss @entity4 . she was a one - off , and i do n't believe the world will ever witness another quite like her . @entity160 comparisons to her late mother - in - law are already @entity3 's cross to bear . should n't a baby girl be spared the same fate ? @entity4 's tragic , untimely death and iconic status will ensure her memory is kept alive for generations to come . she would n't want her granddaughter to languish in her shadow . she would want her to go out into the world , to make her own mark and help those less fortunate , to enrich the lives of others and to carve out her own unique identity -- as @entity58 , @entity57 , @entity59 , @entity60 , or -- my own personal pick -- @entity179 .

( @entity1 ) much like the ardent young royal - watchers of today , enamored by the @entity3 's very being , i was similarly captivated by @entity4 when i was a youngster*****1
she was a rare breed : stunningly beautiful , immediately accessible , witty , charming and endearingly mischievous -- she was one in a million*****0
of course that was long before the , " there were three of us in this marriage , so it was a bit crowded , " interviews and tell - all books alleging suicide attempts and acts of betrayal , but back then i was unaware of her more scandalous infamy*****0
i simply adored her ... i still do*****0
as the world awaits the impending birth of @entity23 and @entity3 's second baby , potential names have become the topic of rampant speculation and heated debate*****1
girls ' names are causing the biggest stir , as there seems to be a belief that the couple are expecting a princess*****0
if the assumptions are correct , she will be the first princess of @entity37 born into the royal family in 182 years*****0
the birth of any baby is cause for celebration , but given recent changes in the laws of succession , her arrival would be a historical one*****0
in choosing a name , titled royals tend to turn to the family tree , rather than a well - thumbed copy of " @entity51 " like the rest of us*****0
traditionally they pick dynastic names , and there are plenty to choose from : @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 have all been frontrunners , but the sentimental favorite among punters remains @entity4*****0
in a recent @entity66 poll , 32 % of @entity64 predicted the name was a shoo - in , and in the @entity68 the bookies ' odds of a baby named after her late grandmother change almost daily as @entity4 becomes an increasingly popular choice*****1
that said , in the event the couple do welcome a baby girl , i would hope that they do not opt to name her @entity4*****0
today @entity4 's name is as divisive as the very institution of monarchy itself : while some have virtually sainted her , others have been vehemently critical , accusing her of being childish , unhinged and self - serving*****0
contrary to popular belief the @entity87 was very fond of @entity4 , but should her name be bestowed as a first name upon the baby , it would be perceived as a slap in the face to the monarchy*****0
in the years since @entity95 's scathing attack on the @entity96 at @entity4 's funeral , the nation has moved on and @entity4 's legacy has been celebrated*****0
she has become a part of royal history*****0
her memory has been preserved , and the royal family is once again enjoying a renewed sense of popularity*****0
out of respect to the @entity87 , @entity107 , @entity108 and the baby herself the couple simply would n't do it*****0
@entity4 's name conjures up both positive and negative responses the world over , and whichever side of the fence you 're on , the moniker seems to me an almighty burden for a newborn baby to carry*****1
since @entity4 's death almost 18 years ago , @entity23 has honored his mother 's memory in a private and personal fashion*****1
he has taken on many of her patronages and continued to champion her causes*****0
at his wedding in 2011 the @entity128 , @entity129 , a close friend of @entity4 and executor of her will , gave the address*****0
the hymn @entity134 , which was sung at both @entity4 's funeral in 1997 and at the memorial marking the tenth anniversary of her death in 2007 , was chosen for the royal wedding*****0
@entity141 , another close friend of @entity4 , was asked to serve as godmother to @entity143*****0
@entity23 chose @entity144 , his own childhood home , to be the primary residence for his family , and in perhaps the most public acknowledgment of his mother 's memory , he gave @entity151 's engagement ring*****0
@entity23 does n't need to name his second - born child after his mother in order to honour her ; he does so by being a good husband and father*****1
i still miss @entity4*****0
she was a one - off , and i do n't believe the world will ever witness another quite like her*****0
@entity160 comparisons to her late mother - in - law are already @entity3 's cross to bear*****0
should n't a baby girl be spared the same fate ? @entity4 's tragic , untimely death and iconic status will ensure her memory is kept alive for generations to come*****0
she would n't want her granddaughter to languish in her shadow*****0
she would want her to go out into the world , to make her own mark and help those less fortunate , to enrich the lives of others and to carve out her own unique identity -- as @entity58 , @entity57 , @entity59 , @entity60 , or -- my own personal pick -- @entity179 .*****0
