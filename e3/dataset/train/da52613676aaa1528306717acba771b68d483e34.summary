( @entity0 ) the justices of the @entity3 practice politics as much as law -- and that will be clearer than ever when the issue of same - sex marriage comes before the court on tuesday . public opinion on same - sex marriage has turned upside down since the @entity10 in @entity11 first legalized the practice in 2003 . overwhelming opposition has turned into substantial majority support , especially among young people of all political persuasions . even the name of the issue has changed -- to marriage equality . of course , the @entity20 has not changed since 2003 , a point that will surely be made by such opponents of same - sex marriage as justice @entity24 . to originalists like @entity24 -- those who believe the @entity20 should be interpreted only as it was originally understood by the framers -- the idea of a constitutional right to same - sex marriage is anathema . to them , the @entity20 means only what it meant to those who wrote it -- and @entity34 ( or the authors of the 14th amendment , just after the @entity37 ) never gave a thought to whether they were granting gay people the right to marry . but the @entity3 has always been about a lot more than the intentions of the framers . and public opinion is just one of the extrajudicial factors that the justices sometimes take into consideration . in 1954 , the @entity3 ruled unanimously that public schools could no longer segregate students by race , even though the authors of the 14th amendment clearly considered segregated schools to be permissible . chief justice @entity54 , who wrote the opinion in @entity56 , recognized that the world had changed , especially in light of the @entity59 . @entity54 knew that segregated schools damaged the @entity61 ' reputation in the contest for hearts and minds around the world , and he steered the court accordingly . @entity54 's motives had nothing to do with the framers ' intentions , and little to do with the words of the @entity20 itself , but these kinds of motivations have been common throughout the history of the @entity3 . there are risks , of course , when the justices are guided by more than the text and history of the @entity20 . like everyone else , the justices have imperfect instincts when it comes to measuring public attitudes . justice @entity86 is a fervent supporter of abortion rights for women , but she has expressed reservations about the court 's decision in @entity92 , the 1973 ruling that required all 50 states to legalize abortion . she has argued that the court interrupted a political process for legalization that was already underway , and that the case ignited a backlash that wound up hurting the cause of abortion rights . her position is debatable on several scores . abortion rights were not ascendant everywhere in the ' 70s , and opponents were already well mobilized . but @entity86 's misgivings about @entity92 have served as an important backdrop to the @entity3 's consideration of same - sex marriage . still , when it comes to @entity3 decisions , it is usually safe to bet that a majority of the justices will come down on the side favored by most of the public . in any case , as we head into the argument , it looks like most of the justices have already made up their minds . after the court decided @entity122 in 2013 , which invalidated most of the 1996 law known as the @entity124 , more than a dozen federal district courts around the county said the reasoning of that case required the legalization of same - sex marriage . these judges allowed these marriages to begin taking place around the country . supporters of the existing laws went to the @entity3 and asked for stays of the lower court rulings , because the justices themselves had not yet permitted the marriages to take place . but in each case , the @entity3 denied the stays and allowed same - sex marriages to proceed -- those marriages are now legal in 37 states and the @entity146 . in a brief dissenting opinion from the failure to grant the stays , justice @entity147 suggested the issue had already been settled in the minds of his colleagues . " this acquiescence [ in allowing marriages to proceed ] may well be seen as a signal of the court 's intended resolution of that question , " @entity147 wrote . " this is not the proper way to discharge our ... responsibilities . " but @entity147 only drew @entity24 to join his dissent , suggesting that even fellow conservatives chief justice @entity163 and @entity165 saw the writing on the wall . in any case , at oral argument , we 'll get a clue what the justices are thinking about the issue . but we already know that their decision , like so many in the court 's history , will be based on a great deal more than the text of the @entity20 .

( @entity0 ) the justices of the @entity3 practice politics as much as law -- and that will be clearer than ever when the issue of same - sex marriage comes before the court on tuesday*****1
public opinion on same - sex marriage has turned upside down since the @entity10 in @entity11 first legalized the practice in 2003*****1
overwhelming opposition has turned into substantial majority support , especially among young people of all political persuasions*****0
even the name of the issue has changed -- to marriage equality*****0
of course , the @entity20 has not changed since 2003 , a point that will surely be made by such opponents of same - sex marriage as justice @entity24*****1
to originalists like @entity24 -- those who believe the @entity20 should be interpreted only as it was originally understood by the framers -- the idea of a constitutional right to same - sex marriage is anathema*****1
to them , the @entity20 means only what it meant to those who wrote it -- and @entity34 ( or the authors of the 14th amendment , just after the @entity37 ) never gave a thought to whether they were granting gay people the right to marry*****0
but the @entity3 has always been about a lot more than the intentions of the framers*****1
and public opinion is just one of the extrajudicial factors that the justices sometimes take into consideration*****0
in 1954 , the @entity3 ruled unanimously that public schools could no longer segregate students by race , even though the authors of the 14th amendment clearly considered segregated schools to be permissible*****0
chief justice @entity54 , who wrote the opinion in @entity56 , recognized that the world had changed , especially in light of the @entity59*****0
@entity54 knew that segregated schools damaged the @entity61 ' reputation in the contest for hearts and minds around the world , and he steered the court accordingly*****1
@entity54 's motives had nothing to do with the framers ' intentions , and little to do with the words of the @entity20 itself , but these kinds of motivations have been common throughout the history of the @entity3*****1
there are risks , of course , when the justices are guided by more than the text and history of the @entity20*****0
like everyone else , the justices have imperfect instincts when it comes to measuring public attitudes*****0
justice @entity86 is a fervent supporter of abortion rights for women , but she has expressed reservations about the court 's decision in @entity92 , the 1973 ruling that required all 50 states to legalize abortion*****0
she has argued that the court interrupted a political process for legalization that was already underway , and that the case ignited a backlash that wound up hurting the cause of abortion rights*****0
her position is debatable on several scores*****0
abortion rights were not ascendant everywhere in the ' 70s , and opponents were already well mobilized*****0
but @entity86 's misgivings about @entity92 have served as an important backdrop to the @entity3 's consideration of same - sex marriage*****1
still , when it comes to @entity3 decisions , it is usually safe to bet that a majority of the justices will come down on the side favored by most of the public*****1
in any case , as we head into the argument , it looks like most of the justices have already made up their minds*****0
after the court decided @entity122 in 2013 , which invalidated most of the 1996 law known as the @entity124 , more than a dozen federal district courts around the county said the reasoning of that case required the legalization of same - sex marriage*****1
these judges allowed these marriages to begin taking place around the country*****0
supporters of the existing laws went to the @entity3 and asked for stays of the lower court rulings , because the justices themselves had not yet permitted the marriages to take place*****1
but in each case , the @entity3 denied the stays and allowed same - sex marriages to proceed -- those marriages are now legal in 37 states and the @entity146*****1
in a brief dissenting opinion from the failure to grant the stays , justice @entity147 suggested the issue had already been settled in the minds of his colleagues*****0
" this acquiescence [ in allowing marriages to proceed ] may well be seen as a signal of the court 's intended resolution of that question , " @entity147 wrote*****0
" this is not the proper way to discharge our ... responsibilities*****0
" but @entity147 only drew @entity24 to join his dissent , suggesting that even fellow conservatives chief justice @entity163 and @entity165 saw the writing on the wall*****1
in any case , at oral argument , we 'll get a clue what the justices are thinking about the issue*****0
but we already know that their decision , like so many in the court 's history , will be based on a great deal more than the text of the @entity20 .*****0
