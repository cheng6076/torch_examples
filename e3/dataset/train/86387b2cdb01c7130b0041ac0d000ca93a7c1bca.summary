( @entity0 ) i see signs of a revolution everywhere . i see it in the op - ed pages of the newspapers , and on the state ballots in nearly half the country . i see it in politicians who once preferred to play it safe with this explosive issue but are now willing to stake their political futures on it . i see the revolution in the eyes of sterling scientists , previously reluctant to dip a toe into this heavily stigmatized world , who are diving in head first . i see it in the new surgeon general who cites data showing just how helpful it can be . i see a revolution in the attitudes of everyday @entity28 . for the first time a majority , 53 % , favor its legalization , with 77 % supporting it for medical purposes . support for legalization has risen 11 points in the past few years alone . in 1969 , the first time @entity38 asked the question about legalization , only 12 % of the nation was in favor . i see a revolution that is burning white hot among young people , but also shows up among the parents and grandparents in my kids ' school . a police officer i met in @entity48 is part of the revolution , as are the editors of the medical journal , @entity53 . i see it in the faces of good parents , uprooting their lives to get medicine for their children -- and in the children themselves , such as @entity62 , who went from having 300 seizures a week to just one or two a month . we know it wo n't consistently have such dramatic results ( or any impact at all ) in others , but what medicine does ? i see this medical marijuana revolution in surprising places . girl 's seizures spur medical marijuana legislation in @entity76 among my colleagues , my patients and my friends . i have even seen the revolution in my own family . a few years ago , when i told my mother i was investigating the topic for a documentary , i was met with a long pause . " marijuana ... ? " she whispered in a half questioning , half disapproving tone . she could barely even say the word and her response filled me with self - doubt . even as a grown man , mom can still make my cheeks turn red and shatter my confidence with a single word . but just last week she suddenly stopped mid-conversation and said , " i am proud of you on the whole marijuana thing . " i waited for the other shoe to drop , but it did n't . instead , she added , " you probably helped a lot of people who were suffering . " i do n't think we had ever had a conversation like that one . at that moment , i saw a revolution that can bring you to tears . the word revolution , comes from the @entity111 , to " turn around . " i had my own turn around a couple of years ago , and at the time it was a lonely place to hold a supportive position on medical marijuana . hardly any government officials would agree to sit down and be interviewed on the topic . even patients i spoke to were reluctant to share their stories . it can be tricky , i learned , to be on the right side of science but on the wrong side of ideology . when we put the first " @entity128 " documentary on television in august 2013 , i did n't know if anyone would watch our yearlong investigation . even worse , i did n't even know if they would care . is weed legal in your state ? just two years later , in " @entity135 , " we are eyewitnesses to a revolution in full swing . you will ride along with us for the dawn of the first federally approved clinical study on the use of marijuana for ptsd . you will meet patients such as @entity144 , an accomplished investment banker , and @entity146 , a stay - at - home mom . they are the remarkable and surprising faces of this revolution -- smart , successful and suffering -- unwilling to accept the fact that commonly prescribed medications often used to treat ptsd can be worse than the underlying disorder itself . @entity144 nearly died , trying to get better . you will see what weed really does to your brain , in crystal clear images . this time around , you will hear from the heads of government agencies earnestly sharing their point of view , both @entity159 and @entity160 senators , and even the @entity162 . this is what a revolution looks like . your medical marijuana questions answered when " @entity167 : @entity171 " aired in march 2014 , @entity169 researcher @entity168 believed the right people were watching . just four days later , @entity168 received a letter in the mail he had been waiting on for seven years that finally provided federal approval for his marijuana study . the federal farm where @entity168 would have to obtain his marijuana is on the campus of @entity179 in @entity180 , @entity181 . in anticipation of a scientific revolution , the production of research - grade marijuana there has increased 30-fold in just the past year . make no mistake , we have plenty of evidence that the approval and support of the federal government can fast track a revolution at a faster pace than we have yet seen . it was the @entity197 that spearheaded the research into a cure for @entity200 , as well as stopping the spread of @entity202 . they were also responsible for the awesome task of eradicating polio and smallpox . other successful federally backed programs include the human genome project , the brain initiative and the @entity210 . there are no shortage of examples where the federal government has been a guardian of our public health needs , and you could argue that medical marijuana would also qualify as a worthwhile investment . 10 diseases where medical marijuana could have impact there is now promising research into the use of marijuana that could impact tens of thousands of children and adults , including treatment for cancer , epilepsy and @entity233 's , to name a few . with regard to pain alone , marijuana could greatly reduce the demand for narcotics and simultaneously decrease the number of accidental painkiller overdoses , which are the greatest cause of preventable death in this country . as i sat across from sens. @entity244 ( @entity246 - @entity245 ) and @entity247 ( @entity248 ) , i knew something extraordinary was happening . they were reciting the story of @entity252 and countless other children . they were quoting back the data we had shared from our earlier investigations . they were extolling the potential virtues of the plant , and all of that was before the interview even started . there was an impatience about them , and they seemed in a hurry to make a large dent in marijuana reform . they want marijuana to be rescheduled . they want it now . they want doctors to be able to prescribe it at @entity279 hospitals all over the country . they want it now . they want research dollars freed up to study the plant . they want it now . they want their fellow lawmakers at the state and national level to acknowledge what most of the world , including the citizens of the @entity28 , have known for a long time : marijuana is a medicine , that should be studied and treated like any other medicine . and they want all of it now . i spent much of our interview challenging them . i needed to remind them that people , long before me or them , have been trying to do many of these same things for 40 years , and had been rejected every time . i reminded them that politicians have a hard time winning elections on the issue of marijuana but less difficulty losing them . i challenged them every step of the way . " this time will be different , " @entity247 confidently told me as he walked out of the room . is marijuana as safe as -- or safer than -- alcohol ? i know how easy it is do nothing because i did nothing for too long . take a good look at the data , educate yourself and talk to the patients , who are often out of options and find their hope in the form of a simple plant . journalists should n't take a position . it makes sense . objectivity is king . but , at some point , open questions do get answered . at some point , contentious issues do get resolved . at some point , common sense prevails . so , here it is : we should legalize medical marijuana . we should do it nationally . and , we should do it now . 9 things to know about legal pot

( @entity0 ) i see signs of a revolution everywhere*****0
i see it in the op - ed pages of the newspapers , and on the state ballots in nearly half the country*****0
i see it in politicians who once preferred to play it safe with this explosive issue but are now willing to stake their political futures on it*****0
i see the revolution in the eyes of sterling scientists , previously reluctant to dip a toe into this heavily stigmatized world , who are diving in head first*****0
i see it in the new surgeon general who cites data showing just how helpful it can be*****0
i see a revolution in the attitudes of everyday @entity28*****0
for the first time a majority , 53 % , favor its legalization , with 77 % supporting it for medical purposes*****0
support for legalization has risen 11 points in the past few years alone*****0
in 1969 , the first time @entity38 asked the question about legalization , only 12 % of the nation was in favor*****0
i see a revolution that is burning white hot among young people , but also shows up among the parents and grandparents in my kids ' school*****0
a police officer i met in @entity48 is part of the revolution , as are the editors of the medical journal , @entity53*****0
i see it in the faces of good parents , uprooting their lives to get medicine for their children -- and in the children themselves , such as @entity62 , who went from having 300 seizures a week to just one or two a month*****0
we know it wo n't consistently have such dramatic results ( or any impact at all ) in others , but what medicine does ? i see this medical marijuana revolution in surprising places*****1
girl 's seizures spur medical marijuana legislation in @entity76 among my colleagues , my patients and my friends*****1
i have even seen the revolution in my own family*****0
a few years ago , when i told my mother i was investigating the topic for a documentary , i was met with a long pause*****0
" marijuana ... ? " she whispered in a half questioning , half disapproving tone*****0
she could barely even say the word and her response filled me with self - doubt*****0

hardly any government officials would agree to sit down and be interviewed on the topic*****0
even patients i spoke to were reluctant to share their stories*****0
it can be tricky , i learned , to be on the right side of science but on the wrong side of ideology*****0
when we put the first " @entity128 " documentary on television in august 2013 , i did n't know if anyone would watch our yearlong investigation*****0
even worse , i did n't even know if they would care*****0
is weed legal in your state ? just two years later , in " @entity135 , " we are eyewitnesses to a revolution in full swing*****0
you will ride along with us for the dawn of the first federally approved clinical study on the use of marijuana for ptsd*****0
you will meet patients such as @entity144 , an accomplished investment banker , and @entity146 , a stay - at - home mom*****0
they are the remarkable and surprising faces of this revolution -- smart , successful and suffering -- unwilling to accept the fact that commonly prescribed medications often used to treat ptsd can be worse than the underlying disorder itself*****0
@entity144 nearly died , trying to get better*****0
you will see what weed really does to your brain , in crystal clear images*****0
this time around , you will hear from the heads of government agencies earnestly sharing their point of view , both @entity159 and @entity160 senators , and even the @entity162*****0
this is what a revolution looks like*****0
your medical marijuana questions answered when " @entity167 : @entity171 " aired in march 2014 , @entity169 researcher @entity168 believed the right people were watching*****1
just four days later , @entity168 received a letter in the mail he had been waiting on for seven years that finally provided federal approval for his marijuana study*****0
the federal farm where @entity168 would have to obtain his marijuana is on the campus of @entity179 in @entity180 , @entity181*****0
in anticipation of a scientific revolution , the production of research - grade marijuana there has increased 30-fold in just the past year*****0
make no mistake , we have plenty of evidence that the approval and support of the federal government can fast track a revolution at a faster pace than we have yet seen*****0
it was the @entity197 that spearheaded the research into a cure for @entity200 , as well as stopping the spread of @entity202*****0
they were also responsible for the awesome task of eradicating polio and smallpox*****0
other successful federally backed programs include the human genome project , the brain initiative and the @entity210*****0
there are no shortage of examples where the federal government has been a guardian of our public health needs , and you could argue that medical marijuana would also qualify as a worthwhile investment*****1
10 diseases where medical marijuana could have impact there is now promising research into the use of marijuana that could impact tens of thousands of children and adults , including treatment for cancer , epilepsy and @entity233 's , to name a few*****1
with regard to pain alone , marijuana could greatly reduce the demand for narcotics and simultaneously decrease the number of accidental painkiller overdoses , which are the greatest cause of preventable death in this country*****0
as i sat across from sens. @entity244 ( @entity246 - @entity245 ) and @entity247 ( @entity248 ) , i knew something extraordinary was happening*****0
they were reciting the story of @entity252 and countless other children*****0
they were quoting back the data we had shared from our earlier investigations*****0
they were extolling the potential virtues of the plant , and all of that was before the interview even started*****0
there was an impatience about them , and they seemed in a hurry to make a large dent in marijuana reform*****0
they want marijuana to be rescheduled*****0
they want it now*****0
they want doctors to be able to prescribe it at @entity279 hospitals all over the country*****0
they want it now*****0
they want research dollars freed up to study the plant*****0
they want it now*****0
they want their fellow lawmakers at the state and national level to acknowledge what most of the world , including the citizens of the @entity28 , have known for a long time : marijuana is a medicine , that should be studied and treated like any other medicine*****1
and they want all of it now*****0
i spent much of our interview challenging them*****0
i needed to remind them that people , long before me or them , have been trying to do many of these same things for 40 years , and had been rejected every time*****0
i reminded them that politicians have a hard time winning elections on the issue of marijuana but less difficulty losing them*****0
i challenged them every step of the way*****0
" this time will be different , " @entity247 confidently told me as he walked out of the room*****0
is marijuana as safe as -- or safer than -- alcohol ? i know how easy it is do nothing because i did nothing for too long*****1
take a good look at the data , educate yourself and talk to the patients , who are often out of options and find their hope in the form of a simple plant*****0
journalists should n't take a position*****0
it makes sense*****0
objectivity is king*****0
but , at some point , open questions do get answered*****0
at some point , contentious issues do get resolved*****0
at some point , common sense prevails*****0
so , here it is : we should legalize medical marijuana*****1
we should do it nationally*****0
and , we should do it now*****0
