( @entity0 ) my name is @entity3 , and i am a professor of @entity4 and @entity6 origins in the @entity7 at @entity8*****0
i was series adviser and one of many on - camera experts on @entity0 's " finding @entity11*****1
" i also appeared in each episode of the program*****0
viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions on the " finding jesus " facebook page during the season finale about @entity18*****1
below are some of the most interesting , and my answers to them*****0
they have been edited for style and clarity for this article : @entity24 : the copy we have of the @entity27 comes from the second century , but is it possible that the gospel itself could be older ( like first century ) ? @entity3 : actually , the copy we saw in the show dates from the fifth century*****0
it is currently located in @entity34 , @entity35*****0
although it 's our most complete manuscript , it is missing several pages*****0
there are two other fragments of the @entity27 , both in @entity40 , and both dating from the third century*****0
it is difficult to date the gospel itself*****0
one of the difficulties is that there are no references to it at all in antiquity*****0
our best guess is that it was written at some point in the middle to late second century*****0
@entity52 : where can we get a good translation of the @entity27 ? @entity3 : there are several good translations of the @entity27*****0
one suggestion is @entity59 's " @entity58 : @entity11 and the @entity60*****0
" that book also has good introduction and discussion materials*****0
one thing that is worth adding is that the @entity27 is not actually called " @entity65*****0
" the term " @entity18 " does not come at all in the texts we have of the @entity27*****0
the heroine is simply called " @entity18*****0
" @entity70 : i would like to know what really happened to @entity18 ? where did she go ? who last saw her ? @entity3 : this is one of the great mysteries about the character ! she is so prominent at the end of each of the @entity82 , and the reader is expecting to see more of her and to hear more about her in the rest of the @entity4 , but there is nothing*****1
she is not mentioned in @entity89 , or in @entity91 's letters , or anywhere else*****0
one possibility is that the early church suppressed her memory and chose not to tell the story of this famous female apostle*****0
but if that is the case , it is surprising that the @entity27 writers pay so much attention to her in their @entity104 and @entity105 narratives*****0
another possibility , and we touched on this in the episode , is that @entity18 died not long after the events narrated in the @entity110*****0
perhaps she was a wealthy , elderly widow ? @ turnbullteacher : would n't @entity111 writing in the second century have written if @entity11 was married or not ? @entity3 : that 's a good question*****1
there is actually nothing in second century writers that says that @entity11 was married and @entity116 ( died 215 ad ) takes for granted that @entity11 was not married*****0
when the " @entity118 " was published in 2012 , it was at first thought that this might witness to a tradition of @entity11 being married from as early as the second century , but it is now clear that the fragment is a modern forgery*****0
@ anna585858 : do you think @entity18 is a nickname or reference to @entity18 's hometown ? @entity3 : it 's a good guess that " @entity18 " refers to @entity129 , and so her name would refer to her hometown , just as @entity11 the " @entity134 " is from @entity133*****1
there are other characters in the @entity4 who are identified by their hometowns*****0
for example @entity140 and @entity141*****0
you are right , though , that it could be a nickname and that it might not have anything to do with @entity129*****0
@ @entity145 : why was the @entity27 left out of the canon of 66 biblical books ? @entity3 : this is a tough one because it is not clear that it was ever in contention*****0
the @entity27 is not even mentioned in any of the extant lists of early @entity6 works*****0
but in any case , the book was probably written too late to have had a chance of competing with @entity156 , @entity3 , @entity157 and @entity158 , all of which are written by the end of the first or , at the latest , the beginning of the second century*****0
further , the @entity27 's theology is different from the theology of what became the four canonical gospels*****0
@ @entity167 : where is it ( said ) that @entity11 had a wife ? @entity3 : there are no ancient texts in which @entity11 had a wife*****0
the closest we get to the idea is the @entity176 in which @entity18 is described as @entity11 ' " companion , " one of three women who always " walked with the @entity179*****0
" the same @entity27 says that @entity11 used to kiss her often , but we do n't know whereabouts he kissed her because there is a hole in the manuscript at just that point ! however , the @entity176 is probably too late ( late second to mid-third century ) to be able to tell us anything reliable about the historical @entity18*****0
funding @entity11 : who bankrolled @entity189 's ministry ? i would like to thank everyone for their great questions over the last six weeks*****1
sorry that fellow on - camera expert @entity194 and i could not get to all of them*****0
thanks too for all the encouraging words about " @entity11*****0
" we are pleased that so many of you have enjoyed and profited from watching it*****0
