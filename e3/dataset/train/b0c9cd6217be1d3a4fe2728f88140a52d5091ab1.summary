( @entity1 ) @entity0 is making headlines for walking out of an interview with a @entity5 journalist who dared to veer away from the superhero movie @entity0 was there to promote . the journalist instead started asking personal questions about the actor 's political beliefs and " dark periods " of addiction and jail time . @entity16 , of course , is abuzz : did journalist @entity17 go too far ? must every interview be a license for a journalist to ask anything he 'd like ? from the start of the 7 - minute television interview , it seems evident that @entity0 is not particularly interested in being there , even if being there was , ultimately , a benefit to him -- after all , he 's promoting his latest film , " @entity29 : age of @entity31 . " he grows increasingly agitated , even as the line of questioning remains on - topic ; his attitude , meanwhile , grew increasingly smug . his eyes glaze over as the reporter talks , he makes condescending comments and gestures that seem intended to intimidate and imply he 's much smarter than @entity17 , and he repeatedly looks toward his handler as if to say , " do i really have to sit here with this guy ? " at one point , he makes fun of @entity17 for seeming nervous , saying , " your foot is starting to jump a little bit . you better get to your next question . " but it 's after @entity17 asks @entity0 whether he thinks he is " free from all of that , " referring to @entity0 's history of " taking drugs , drinking " that the building tension comes to a head . " i 'm sorry , " says @entity0 , " what are we doing ? " to which @entity17 replies , " i 'm just asking questions , " which indeed was so . @entity0 has the right to refuse to answer the question , of course , but that 's not what he does next . instead , he throws the celebrity interview equivalent of a tantrum : he smiles arrogantly , says " bye ! " and stands up to leave . he sure showed him ! it 's true that we live in a culture where we feel we have the right to know everything about celebrities -- who they 're dating , what they 're eating , where they vacation , what they meant when they made that comment 10 years ago . journalists often go too far , even if it 's their job . and certainly not every journalist is good at his job . but while @entity0 may be understandably tired of answering questions about his past , questions that have been asked before , his business is our business . the entertainment industry is about entertaining people . as such , we tend to like to watch actors who seem like they want to be watched . this is why most celebrities , especially those with a big budget movie to promote , agree to interviews and seek out recognition in general . but when the recognition no longer serves them ? then they want to bemoan it ? what @entity0 seemed to misunderstand is that the interview format gives journalists the right to ask questions . that 's what an interview is . he certainly can decline to answer questions he does not feel are appropriate , or even ones he simply does n't feel like answering . but he does not have the right to be absolved for behavior that is rude , demeaning , and disrespectful -- even if he 's a celebrity , and even if he felt uncomfortable or put - off . what the video shows is a movie star with a bullying streak . after he removes his microphone and his handlers begin hustling him out with kid gloves , the actor can not resist a parting shot . he turns to the reporter , being sure to look directly at the camera on the way , and says , " you seem okay . it 's just getting a little @entity126 in here , " followed by what sounds like , " and you 're kind of a schmuck . " @entity0 might not have been " in the mood " to be questioned ... and those days , those moods , are understandable . we all have them . and yet in this case , that 's , well , too bad . the actor has agreed to an interview as part of his job . he has agreed to engage in a conversation with another professional human being . given the terms , he is not entitled to call all the shots . that he thinks he can is perhaps our own , celebrity - obsessed doing -- we revere the famous ; is it any surprise when they reveal that they , too , regard themselves as better than everyone else ? but it 's still on him .

the journalist instead started asking personal questions about the actor 's political beliefs and " dark periods " of addiction and jail time*****1
@entity16 , of course , is abuzz : did journalist @entity17 go too far ? must every interview be a license for a journalist to ask anything he 'd like ? from the start of the 7 - minute television interview , it seems evident that @entity0 is not particularly interested in being there , even if being there was , ultimately , a benefit to him -- after all , he 's promoting his latest film , " @entity29 : age of @entity31*****1

he sure showed him ! it 's true that we live in a culture where we feel we have the right to know everything about celebrities -- who they 're dating , what they 're eating , where they vacation , what they meant when they made that comment 10 years ago*****0
journalists often go too far , even if it 's their job*****0
and certainly not every journalist is good at his job*****0
but while @entity0 may be understandably tired of answering questions about his past , questions that have been asked before , his business is our business*****1
the entertainment industry is about entertaining people*****0
as such , we tend to like to watch actors who seem like they want to be watched*****0
this is why most celebrities , especially those with a big budget movie to promote , agree to interviews and seek out recognition in general*****1
but when the recognition no longer serves them ? then they want to bemoan it ? what @entity0 seemed to misunderstand is that the interview format gives journalists the right to ask questions*****1
that 's what an interview is*****0
he certainly can decline to answer questions he does not feel are appropriate , or even ones he simply does n't feel like answering*****0
but he does not have the right to be absolved for behavior that is rude , demeaning , and disrespectful -- even if he 's a celebrity , and even if he felt uncomfortable or put - off*****1
what the video shows is a movie star with a bullying streak*****0
after he removes his microphone and his handlers begin hustling him out with kid gloves , the actor can not resist a parting shot*****0
he turns to the reporter , being sure to look directly at the camera on the way , and says , " you seem okay*****0
it 's just getting a little @entity126 in here , " followed by what sounds like , " and you 're kind of a schmuck*****0
