( @entity2 ) @entity1 life wo n't be pretty for @entity3 , the former @entity4 player and convicted murderer sentenced to life without parole . after correction officers evaluate him , he will be shipped to @entity10 ' flagship maximum - security prison , one of the most high - tech jails in the @entity13 with no history of breakouts : the @entity16 in @entity17 , about 40 miles outside downtown @entity18 . it 's called @entity20 , for short , and it 's the state 's newest prison , opened in 1998 , with a matrix of 366 cameras recording live 24 hours a day and a microwave detection perimeter with taut wire . " i do n't know the date , but he 'll be going there . that 's the maximum - security facility , " @entity31 spokesman @entity30 said . legal advocates for inmates describe @entity20 as sterile and violent at once . its diverse demographic includes the young and the old , many of whom are also doing life . one stubborn problem is that opiates are smuggled to inmates , the legal advocates said . " it 's very shiny and clean looking and very sterile , " said @entity43 , executive director of @entity44 , who has been visiting the @entity47 prison about every six weeks for the past 15 years and serves indigent prisoners there . but , she added : " it is a very dangerous prison that is right now experiencing a veritable flood of opiates .

" at this point in time , we will figure out where he belongs in the population once the processing of @entity3 is complete , " @entity30 said . " right now , he 'll be treated like a regular inmate when he walked into the door , but they will figure all that out .

" that superintendent , @entity118 , could n't be immediately reached for comment wednesday . because of his celebrity , @entity3 may find himself signing autographs for other inmates and even guards , said @entity124 , a former federal inmate who spent 10 years in high - and minimum - security prisons . " there will be a lot of staff that will treat him like an animal that he is , but there will be other staff that will want his autograph and treat him like a star , " said @entity124 , who founded @entity126 , which advises offenders and convicts heading to prison . in the long run , however , it may not matter much in what section of the prison @entity3 does his time . about 90 % of the inmates in the maximum - security prison are locked in their cells for 19 hours a day , said @entity98 , the legal advocate . " it 's pretty grim , " @entity98 said . @entity20 has slightly larger cells than most other @entity10 prisons , but not by much , @entity98 said . even so , the cells are stark , small rooms of painted cinder - block walls with metal fixtures : a bunk mounted to the wall , a toilet and sink combination , a small writing shelf attached to the wall , and a nearby small stool affixed to the floor , @entity98 said . there 's also a shelf for a small television , which must have a clear back for easy inspection , @entity98 said . with the exception of the tv , which inmates can buy for under $ 200 , all furnishings are metal and bolted down to keep inmates from throwing them , she said . there are two windows : one roughly 4 by 20 inches with clear glass that looks outdoors to a wall , building or trees , and a tiny window on the cell door , which has two slots , for handcuffing in the middle and ankle cuffing at the foot of the door , she said . " there 's very little to do , " @entity98 said of inmate life . " it was built as a punishment facility . the thing in corrections is that you do n't want people to like it there . some people have been there since it opened , and those people are excruciatingly bored or scared or both .

" solitary confinement is a kind of torture that no one does well in . the lack of meaningful sensory stimulus and contact drives people mad , " @entity98 said . initially , " prison officials may feel they have to put him there for his safety , but i hope not , " @entity98 said .
