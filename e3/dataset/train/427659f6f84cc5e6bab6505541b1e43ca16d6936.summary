( @entity4 ) from late january , when @entity5 was living through one of its bleakest and snowiest winters , to a warm and sunny afternoon in april , the jurors in the first - degree murder trial of former @entity3 star @entity2 have considered how a promising young athlete who earned millions came to take the life of his onetime friend and future brother - in - law , @entity11 . the jury of seven women and five men listened to more than 130 witnesses and reviewed more than 400 pieces of evidence over the months - long trial . on wednesday , they convicted @entity2 , who was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole , after deliberating more than 35 hours over parts of seven days . after the verdict , jurors agreed to meet with reporters , at times laughing nervously while shedding light on what some described as the grueling deliberation process . here are five things to know about what they said : while declining to discuss specifics of what happened in the jury room , jurors said they came away satisfied with their decision . " it 's a very big decision to make , and every one of us ... made sure we came to the best conclusion , " one juror told reporters . at one point on monday , jurors asked judge @entity46 to allow smoking breaks , which were permitted during trial . some observers thought this signaled weeks of deliberations . a male juror said some panel members had meticulously filled four to eight notebooks as they listened to testimony . " it was hard ... for everyone , " said a woman on the jury . " everyone 's life changed because of this . " asked to elaborate , she told a reporter , " i 've been here for as long as you have . " " it 's the hardest thing i 've ever done in my life , " she said later about serving on the jury . " absolutely , by far . " asked whether they would say anything to @entity2 , one of the women on the panel said simply , " nothing . " others nodded in apparent agreement . do they have any feelings about the 25 - year - old former star ? " for me , judge @entity46 said , ' keep your mind suspended , ' " said a female juror . " we went in there every day with open minds . we listened to the evidence . we heard what they had to say . we got to go into a room and see and touch and feel all the evidence and that 's when we came to our conclusion . " did they know anything about @entity2 or the case before the trial ? one juror responded : " nothing . " " very little , " said another . about six jurors raised their hands when asked who among them was a @entity5 fan . the jurors said they found out about @entity2 's other legal woes from @entity46 only after they reached a verdict . @entity2 potentially faces three more trials , one criminal and two civil actions . next up is another murder trial in which he is accused of killing two men and wounding another person near a @entity112 nightclub in july 2012 . prosecutors have said @entity2 fatally shot @entity114 and @entity115 when he fired into their 2003 @entity116 . another passenger was wounded and two others were uninjured . @entity2 pleaded not guilty at his arraignment . the families of @entity114 and @entity115 filed civil suits against @entity2 , and a judge froze his $ 5 million in assets , pending the outcome of the double - murder trial . the freeze includes the disputed $ 3.3 million signing bonus payment @entity2 claims he is owed by the @entity5 . @entity2 is also being sued by a man who claims @entity2 shot him while they were in a limousine in @entity131 in february 2013 . @entity132 claims @entity2 wounded him after the two got into a fight at a @entity131 strip club . " it 's amazing a lot of the information we learned today , " a female juror said wednesday . " i think we can all say we made the right decision . " some jurors admitted to not knowing who @entity5 owner @entity144 was when he took the stand at the trial . but they agreed that @entity149 's testimony was crucial . @entity144 testified that @entity2 proclaimed his innocence to him and told the team owner that " he hoped that the time of the murder ... came out because i believe he said he was in a club . " " to this day -- we just went through a three - month trial , and this is now two years later -- we still do n't know the exact time of @entity11 's murder , " a male juror said . " so i do n't know how @entity2 would have had that information two years ago . " another juror was struck by the emotional testimony of @entity11 's family and friends . " for me , it was in the beginning -- the pictures , " a woman said of autopsy photos of @entity11 's bullet - riddled body . " you 're told to be unemotional and to sit there and hold back tears ... ( that ) was hard . " one man said his time on the case made him " appreciate how quickly life can end and how fleeting it can be . " and that the justice system can work . " the system is designed to be fair to both sides , " he said . " in fairness , you ca n't rush . " the jurors did not find credible the defense team 's contention that @entity2 's co-defendants -- @entity190 and @entity191 -- carried out the murder . the two men have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately . in closing arguments , defense lawyer @entity194 for the first time placed @entity2 at the murder scene . @entity194 described @entity190 and @entity191 as a pair of drug dealers known to become crazed while on @entity201 , as men capable of killing someone in drug - induced fits of rage .

" he was a 23 - year - old kid who witnessed something , committed by somebody he knew . he really did n't know what to do , so he put one foot in front of another . keep in mind , he 's not charged with accessory after the fact . ... he 's charged with murder ... and that he did not do .
