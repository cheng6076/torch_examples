( @entity1 ) for 12 years @entity0 felt worthless , frightened and alone , never knowing when her abusive husband would strike . but as a young mother in rural @entity4 with three children and barely a third grade education , she thought there was no way out . what began as psychological torment , name - calling and humiliation turned into beatings so severe @entity0 feared for her life . one day , two men sent by her husband showed up at her house armed with a shotgun and orders to kill her . they probably would have succeeded , but after the first bullet was fired , @entity0 ' two sons dragged her inside . still , in her deeply conservative community , it took neighbors two hours to call for help and @entity0 lost her arm . but the abuse did n't stop there . when she returned home , @entity0 ' husband continued his attacks and threatened to rape their little girl unless she left . that 's when the nightmare finally ended and her search for justice began . @entity0 ' case is dramatic , but in @entity4 , where nearly 10 out of every 100,000 women are killed , it 's hardly unusual . a 2012 @entity44 says gender - based violence is at epidemic levels in @entity4 and the country ranks third in the killings of women worldwide . according to the @entity51 , two women are killed there every day . there are many reasons why , beginning with the legacy of violence left in place after the country 's 36 - year - old civil war . during the conflict , atrocities were committed against women , who were used as a weapon of war . in 1996 , a ceasefire agreement was reached between insurgents and the government . but what followed and what remains is a climate of terror , due to a deeply entrenched culture of impunity and discrimination . military and paramilitary groups that committed barbaric acts during the war were integrated back into society without any repercussions . many remain in power , and they have not changed the way they view women . some 200,000 people were either killed or disappeared during the decades - long conflict , most of them from indigenous @entity88 populations . nearly 20 years later , according to the @entity91 , levels of violent crime are higher in @entity4 than they were during the war . but despite the high homicide rate , the @entity51 estimates 98 % of cases never make it to court . women are particularly vulnerable because of a deep - rooted gender bias and culture of misogyny . in many cases , femicide -- the killing of a woman simply because of her gender -- is carried out with shocking brutality with some of the same strategies used during the war , including rape , torture and mutilation . @entity112 drug cartels , organized criminal groups and local gangs are contributing to the vicious cycle of violence and lawlessness . authorities investigating drug - related killings are stretched thin , leaving fewer resources to investigate femicides . in many cases , crime is not reported because of fear of retaliation . many consider the @entity127 , or @entity128 , corrupt , under - resourced and ineffective . even if a case does get prosecuted , according to @entity131 , the country 's weak judicial system has proved incapable of handling the explosion in violence . perhaps one of the biggest challenges facing women in @entity4 is the country 's deeply rooted patriarchal society . according to @entity144 , the representative of @entity51 women in @entity4 , " 80 % of men believe that women need permission to leave the house , and 70 % of women surveyed agreed .

( @entity1 ) for 12 years @entity0 felt worthless , frightened and alone , never knowing when her abusive husband would strike*****0
but as a young mother in rural @entity4 with three children and barely a third grade education , she thought there was no way out*****0
what began as psychological torment , name - calling and humiliation turned into beatings so severe @entity0 feared for her life*****1
one day , two men sent by her husband showed up at her house armed with a shotgun and orders to kill her*****0
they probably would have succeeded , but after the first bullet was fired , @entity0 ' two sons dragged her inside*****0
still , in her deeply conservative community , it took neighbors two hours to call for help and @entity0 lost her arm*****0
but the abuse did n't stop there*****0
when she returned home , @entity0 ' husband continued his attacks and threatened to rape their little girl unless she left*****0
that 's when the nightmare finally ended and her search for justice began*****0
@entity0 ' case is dramatic , but in @entity4 , where nearly 10 out of every 100,000 women are killed , it 's hardly unusual*****1
a 2012 @entity44 says gender - based violence is at epidemic levels in @entity4 and the country ranks third in the killings of women worldwide*****1
according to the @entity51 , two women are killed there every day*****1
there are many reasons why , beginning with the legacy of violence left in place after the country 's 36 - year - old civil war*****1
during the conflict , atrocities were committed against women , who were used as a weapon of war*****0
in 1996 , a ceasefire agreement was reached between insurgents and the government*****0
but what followed and what remains is a climate of terror , due to a deeply entrenched culture of impunity and discrimination*****0
military and paramilitary groups that committed barbaric acts during the war were integrated back into society without any repercussions*****0
many remain in power , and they have not changed the way they view women*****0
some 200,000 people were either killed or disappeared during the decades - long conflict , most of them from indigenous @entity88 populations*****1
nearly 20 years later , according to the @entity91 , levels of violent crime are higher in @entity4 than they were during the war*****1
but despite the high homicide rate , the @entity51 estimates 98 % of cases never make it to court*****0
women are particularly vulnerable because of a deep - rooted gender bias and culture of misogyny*****1
in many cases , femicide -- the killing of a woman simply because of her gender -- is carried out with shocking brutality with some of the same strategies used during the war , including rape , torture and mutilation*****0
@entity112 drug cartels , organized criminal groups and local gangs are contributing to the vicious cycle of violence and lawlessness*****0
authorities investigating drug - related killings are stretched thin , leaving fewer resources to investigate femicides*****0
in many cases , crime is not reported because of fear of retaliation*****0
many consider the @entity127 , or @entity128 , corrupt , under - resourced and ineffective*****0
even if a case does get prosecuted , according to @entity131 , the country 's weak judicial system has proved incapable of handling the explosion in violence*****0
perhaps one of the biggest challenges facing women in @entity4 is the country 's deeply rooted patriarchal society*****1
according to @entity144 , the representative of @entity51 women in @entity4 , " 80 % of men believe that women need permission to leave the house , and 70 % of women surveyed agreed*****1
" this prevailing culture of machismo and an institutionalized acceptance of brutality against women leads to high rates of violence*****1
rights groups say machismo not only condones violence , it places the blame on the victim*****0
the political will to address violence against women is slow to materialize*****1
" politicians do n't think women are important , " says former secretary general of the @entity161 for women @entity162*****0
" political parties use women for elections*****0
they give them a bag of food and people sell their dignity for this because they are poor*****0
" lack of education is a major contributor to this poverty*****0
many girls , especially in indigenous communities do n't go to school because the distance from their house to the classroom is too far*****0

with the help of an organization known as @entity197 , or @entity198 , @entity0 was finally able to escape her husband and get the justice she deserved*****0
he is now spending 27 years behind bars*****0
@entity0 is using her painful past to provide hope and healing to others through art. since 2008 , she and four other abuse survivors known as @entity208 , or " @entity209 , " have been appearing in a play based on their real life stories*****1
the show not only empowers other women and discusses the problem of violence openly , but it also offers suggestions for change*****1
and it 's having an impact*****0
women have started breaking their silence and asking where they can get support*****0
men are reacting , too*****0
one of the main characters , @entity226 , says during one presentation , a man stood up and started crying when he realized how he had treated his wife and how his mother had been treated*****0
he said he wanted to be different*****0
the taboo topic of gender - based violence is also being acknowledged and recognized in a popular program targeting one of @entity4 's most vulnerable groups , indigenous @entity88 girls*****1
in 2004 , with help from the @entity51 and other organizations , the @entity237 launched a community - based club known as @entity242 , or " @entity243 "*****1
the goal is to provide girls with a safe place to learn about their rights and reach their full potential*****0
senior program coordinator @entity249 says the issue of violence is discussed and girls are taught how to protect themselves*****0
" they then share this information with their mothers and for the first time , they realize they are entitled to certain rights*****0
" @entity249 adds that mothers then become invested in sending their daughters to the clubs and this keeps them more visible and less prone to violence*****0
the @entity4 government is also moving in the right direction to address the problem of violence against women*****1
in 2008 , the @entity268 passed a law against femicide*****0
two years later the attorney general 's office created a specialized court to try femicides and other violent crimes against women*****0
in 2012 , the government established a joint task force for crimes against women , making it easier for women to access justice by making sure victims receive the assistance they need*****0
the government has also established a special 24 - hour court to attend to femicide cases*****0
on the global front , the @entity287 was introduced in the @entity268 in 2007 ; it has been pending ever since*****0
but last week the act was reintroduced in both the @entity290 and @entity291*****0
if approved , it would make reducing levels of gender - based violence a @entity296 foreign policy priority*****1
pehaps the most immediate and effective help is coming from international nongovernmental organizations , which are on the front lines of the fight against gender - based discrimination in @entity4*****1
@entity303 , a senior policy advocate at the global poverty fighting group @entity304 , says , " we work to identify and challenge harmful social norms that perpetuate violence*****0
our work includes engaging men and boys as champions of change and role models , and facilitating debates to change harmful norms and create space for more equitable relationships between men and women*****0
" but the job is far from over*****0
while there is tempered optimism and hope for change , the problem of gender - based violence in @entity4 is one that needs international attention and immediate action*****1
@entity0 is finding strength through the theater and the support of other abuse survivors , which has allowed her to move forward*****1
but millions of other women trapped in a cycle of violence are facing dangerous and frightening futures*****1
for them , it 's a race against time and help can not come soon enough .*****0
