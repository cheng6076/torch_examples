@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) the cramped galley of the ship is filled with the smell of fresh garlic frying in olive oil*****0
@entity8 , a tall , thin , sunburned 27 - year veteran of @entity1 's @entity9 ( @entity10 ) is waxing eloquent on his favorite subject : food*****0
" we picked it this morning from the hills of @entity0 , " he declares with a flourish , waving thin sprigs of wild asparagus under my nose*****0
he demonstrates how you must break it apart with your fingers , bit by bit , until you get to the hard part , which you keep aside to boil down in water for the pasta sauce he is preparing with his shipmate , @entity31*****0
cooking , however , may be a positive distraction from dark memories*****0
how i was smuggled into @entity34 -- and why it was worth it we boarded the @entity10 's ship , the @entity38 , in @entity0 harbor earlier in the evening*****0
the @entity38 regularly patrols the @entity41 off @entity0 , which is @entity1 's southernmost territory and just 70 miles , or just over 110 kilometers , from the @entity43 coast*****1
in recent years , it has been the first point of entry to @entity34 for tens of thousands of migrants from @entity47 and the @entity48*****0
a few years ago , the @entity38 was on the look out for " contrabandisti , " smugglers trafficking in cigarettes and drugs*****0
but in recent years , its 12 - man crew has joined @entity1 's effort to rescue migrants coming from @entity47 and the @entity48*****1
we spend seven hours on board the ship , but nothing much happens*****0
we see some @entity1 fishing boats the crew knew by sight*****1
shortly after sunset , the @entity38 's captain , @entity64 , begins calling out quick orders to his men as we approach a small boat*****1
the easy - going crew seem to tense up*****0
one man turns on a bright spotlight and focuses the beam on the boat , while another with powerful binoculars read out the name on the back*****0
@entity64 peers intently at the boat , which appears to be a fishing vessel , then shrugs*****1
" it 's fine , " he tells me*****0
" if it were low in the water , we 'd know it was full of people , but this boat is riding high*****1
" he waves to the @entity43 boat , where an older man in a jacket waves back*****0
@entity64 gives him a thumbs up , and steers the ship to the right*****0
it 's a routine evening for the @entity38 , and that is just fine with the crew*****1
they 've seen enough troubles in their time to appreciate an uneventful day 's work*****0
back in the galley , i ask @entity8 about his worst experience while serving at sea with the @entity9*****0
he and most of his shipmates took part in the rescue effort on october 3 , 2013 , after a ship with hundreds of migrants had gone down off @entity0*****1
more than 350 people died in that disaster*****1
the crew of the @entity38 was able to rescue four of the survivors*****1
@entity8 's cheery demeanor suddenly becomes serious*****0
" i still remember pulling out of the water , with our hands , a young , pregnant woman who had just died , " he recalls*****0
" there were children , " adds his crewmate , @entity31 , shaking his head*****0
" we recovered the bodies of children*****0
it was a bad situation*****0
i remember the body of a boy we recovered*****0
we put him in a body bag*****0
his head was in this hand , " he said waving his hand as if he had just picked up the lifeless body*****0
why migrants are risking their lives to reach @entity1 @entity8 and @entity141 stress that as fathers , there is nothing worse than having to see the bodies of dead children*****1
" at the moment , " recalls @entity8 , " we were too busy to think about it , but when we go home , before going to sleep , it comes back to us*****0
" he emphasizes that he and his shipmates were just doing their duty as professional military men*****0
out in the @entity41 , with no land in sight , you realize just how vast it is*****0
and although it 's been warm on land in @entity161 recently , at night on the water , it 's cold and windy*****0
on board the @entity38 , we are warm , well - fed and in good company*****0
the ship is well - maintained and equipped with state - of - the - art equipment , allowing @entity64 to plow confidently through the waves in the dark without fear of running into anything*****0
it contrasts starkly with conditions migrants have recounted to us of the rickety boats and unseaworthy rubber dinghies they use to try to cross the @entity41*****1
often they 're without food , water or shelter , their boat 's crew inexperienced and untrained*****1
that 's if they have a crew at all*****0
many migrants have been beaten and robbed of all their possessions before they board*****0
and unless a ship like the @entity38 comes to their rescue , death at sea is a definite possibility .*****1
