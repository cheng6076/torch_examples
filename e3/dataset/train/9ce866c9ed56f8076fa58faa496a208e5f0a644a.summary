( @entity2 ) an unmanned @entity4 spacecraft originally bound for the @entity5 will re-enter the @entity7 's atmosphere after flight controllers lost contact with it , @entity1 astronaut @entity0 said wednesday . the spacecraft that lost contact with flight controllers will re-enter the @entity7 's atmosphere in about a week , @entity11 , the @entity11 , said wednesday . " @entity11 ( the @entity11 ) announced that the @entity15 will not be docking and will re-enter the @entity7 's atmosphere , " @entity0 said from the space station . the progress resupply vehicle will come off its orbit and will begin its combustion in the atmosphere between may 5 and may 7 , according to @entity11 . the progress vehicle does not present any danger to the @entity5 due to a significant difference in orbit , @entity11 added . the @entity4 space agency said it is working on its next supply flight to the @entity5 and expects to launch a new progress ship in the third quarter of this year . @entity4 lost contact with @entity15 59 during a resupply mission to the @entity5 . the ship is now spinning out of control , @entity30 said . even if @entity4 had n't lost contact with the craft , the original plan was for @entity15 to burn up re-entering @entity7 's atmosphere -- albeit with garbage rather than a full load of equipment for the space station . according to @entity30 information on the progress resupply vehicle , " after the cargo is removed and before the progress undocks , the crew refills it with trash , unneeded equipment and wastewater , which will burn up with the spacecraft when it re-enters the @entity7 's atmosphere . " the cargo spacecraft launched successfully early tuesday from the @entity51 in @entity52 . but after it separated from the @entity56 booster rocket 's third stage , @entity4 flight controllers were unable to confirm the health of all the spacecraft 's systems , including the deployment of navigational antennae , @entity30 said . " the spacecraft made another pass over @entity4 ground stations and continued to experience telemetry problems regarding the deployment of navigational antennas and the pressurization of the manifolds in the propulsion system , " the @entity1 space agency said in an update . a planned rendezvous with the @entity5 six hours later was initially postponed to thursday but has now been canceled , @entity30 said in its latest update . " docking has been called off for the @entity77 spacecraft , " it said . " @entity4 flight controllers are continuing to assess the vehicle and what the plan going forward will be . additional information will be provided as it becomes available . " few details have been forthcoming so far from @entity11 . according to @entity30 , the cargo ship is carrying more than 3 tons of food , fuel , oxygen , spare parts and scientific experiment hardware for the space station . but the hitch will not put the six @entity5 crew members at risk , @entity30 said . " the spacecraft was not carrying any supplies critical for the @entity96 ( @entity96 ) of the station , " a statement said . " both the @entity4 and @entity96 segments of the station continue to operate normally and are adequately supplied well beyond the next planned resupply flight . " that next flight , which will be the seventh @entity102 commercial resupply services mission to the space station , is not scheduled to take off before june 19 , @entity30 said . meanwhile , @entity4 flight controllers continue their efforts to make contact with @entity77 as it passes over @entity4 ground stations . @entity30 said tuesday that @entity4 flight controllers had " confirmed that the vehicle had entered into a slow spin and have issued commands to attempt to control it . " according to @entity4 state news agency @entity113 , six attempts to make contact were to be made wednesday . the @entity1 supplies on board the spacecraft include spare parts for the station 's environmental control and life support system , backup spacewalk hardware and crew clothing , " all of which are replaceable , " @entity30 said . @entity1 astronaut @entity125 , from @entity126 , is the current space station commander . @entity2 's @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 contributed to this report .
