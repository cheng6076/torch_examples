( @entity0 ) ever had a headache so big , you felt like drilling a hole in your head to let the pain out ? in @entity7 times trepanation -- or drilling a hole into the skull -- was thought to be a cure for everything from epilepsy to migraines*****0
it could even have been a form of emergency surgery for battle wounds*****0
but while there is still conjecture about the real reasons behind the mysterious procedure , what is known is that the implement often used to carry out the primitive surgery was made from one of the sharpest substances found in nature -- obsidian*****0
@entity27 -- a type of volcanic glass -- can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels*****1
at 30 angstroms -- a unit of measurement equal to one hundred millionth of a centimeter -- an obsidian scalpel can rival diamond in the fineness of its edge*****0
when you consider that most household razor blades are 300 - 600 angstroms , obsidian can still cut it with the sharpest materials nano - technology can produce*****1
even today , a small number of surgeons are using an ancient technology to carry out fine incisions that they say heal with minimal scarring*****1
