( @entity1 ) the @entity0 on saturday called for an immediate 24 - hour ceasefire in battle - torn @entity3 , saying many more people recently wounded in airstrikes and ground fighting will die if not tended to soon*****0
the call came just before the @entity8 met late saturday morning to discuss the situation in the @entity11 nation , where @entity13 rebels are pitted against external @entity15 air forces and fighters loyal to @entity3 's displaced @entity18 president*****1
a pause was needed especially in and near the southern @entity3 port city of @entity22 , where intense fighting has happened in the past two weeks , the @entity19 said*****0
food , water , medical items and personnel need to get into these areas , the group said*****0
" otherwise , put starkly , many more people will die*****0
for the wounded , their chances of survival depend on action within hours , not days , " @entity31 , the @entity19 's head of operations in the near and @entity34 , said*****0
another @entity0 official said people are running out of food , water and fuel*****0
" medical supplies need to be here yesterday*****0
the situation is difficult , " said @entity46 , a spokeswoman for the @entity19 who is in the capital , @entity48*****1
" we need to save the lives that can be saved*****0
" meanwhile , residents of @entity48 , witnessed the fiercest @entity54 strikes since the air assault started last week*****1
military facilities , including two bases , within the city limits have been targeted , three senior security officials in @entity48 said*****1
at the @entity8 , @entity60 submitted a draft resolution calling for a halt to the airstrikes that a nine - country regional coalition , led by @entity54 , has been conducting against the rebels in @entity3 for more than a week*****1
the meeting adjourned with no decision announced*****0
one diplomat said the draft was missing what the envoy called key elements*****0
it does n't call for the @entity76 to stop fighting , and it does not call for political talks between the belligerents , the diplomat told @entity1 on condition of anonymity*****0
@entity3 has been descending into chaos in the weeks since @entity76 rebels -- minority shiites who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority @entity18 country -- forced @entity3 president @entity85 from power in january*****0
the @entity76 put @entity85 under house arrest when they overtook @entity48 in january*****0
but @entity85 escaped in february , fled to @entity22 and declared himself to still be president*****0
@entity76 and their allies , including those loyal to @entity85 's predecessor , then fought @entity85 's forces in the @entity22 area*****0
@entity85 fled @entity22 in late march , ultimately for @entity54 , when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city*****1
the conflict prompted @entity54 , a predominately @entity18 nation and @entity3 's northern neighbor , and other @entity15 nations to hit the rebels in @entity3 with airstrikes*****1
a @entity54 source told @entity1 that special forces supplied weapons and communication equipment to @entity3 fighters in @entity22 loyal to @entity85*****0
the @entity76 were retreating from areas in the center of the city , including the presidential palace there , the source said*****0
@entity54 special forces help oppose @entity76 rebels in @entity3 , source says the @entity116 said thursday that at least 519 people have been killed in @entity3 in the past two weeks*****0
an additional 1,700 have been wounded*****0
tens of thousands have fled to nearby @entity120 and @entity121*****0
in @entity22 alone , fighting has killed 58 people and injured 200 more in the past two days , @entity3 security officials said*****0
at least 24 of the dead were @entity76*****0
complicating matters in @entity3 is that @entity126 -- not the @entity76 or @entity85 - loyal forces -- holds sway in the country 's east*****0
@entity126 is considered one of the most ruthless branches of the terrorist organization*****0
also late this week , photos circulating on social media purported to show senior @entity126 leader @entity136 -- whom @entity3 defense officials said militants busted out of jail on thursday -- posing in a presidential residence in southern @entity3*****1
@entity142 fighters freed @entity136 with some 270 prisoners when they overran the town of @entity145*****0
on saturday , the @entity147 military evacuated 44 people , including some @entity147 nationals , from the eastern @entity3 port city of @entity151*****0
