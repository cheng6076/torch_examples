( @entity6 ) in response to reports of big banks threatening to withhold campaign funds from @entity5 , sen. @entity0 last week offered a defiant response : " bring it on*****1
" @entity8 said she is n't going to slack off on her calls for breaking up banks and other measures to rein in @entity12*****1
as @entity13 prepares to officially launch her presidential campaign this month , she will need to make a choice about how much to highlight issues relating to economic inequality*****1
former @entity19 gov. @entity18 , who is also running for the @entity21 nomination , is trying to steal @entity23 's thunder by talking about the problems of disproportionate wealth*****0
in other words , there are many signs that @entity5 are planning to take on the big issue of economic inequality*****0
but in other recent news , the likelihood that @entity33 's @entity32 will replace @entity34 as leader of the @entity5 means the dreams of a more economically leftward party are crashing into political reality*****1
while @entity32 has been a very effective @entity40 and skilled legislative leader , he is also a @entity12 @entity40 who has spent much of his time courting and protecting powerful financial interests who run one of the dominant industries in his state*****0
he is not alone*****0
even at his most progressive moments , president @entity48 relied on @entity12 donations for both of his campaigns*****1
despite all the talk from conservatives about left - wing " socialism " in the @entity58 , the financial community has been willing to open its coffers to @entity5 without much concern , even in the 2012 election*****0
@entity21 populism ca n't really work within the current campaign finance system*****1
the enormous pressures for parties to raise funds in campaigns has for many decades created pressure on @entity5 , despite their political base , to court big donors*****0
during the 1980s , @entity73 democrat @entity72 , serving as the chairman of the @entity75 and then as majority whip , made a strong appeal to savings and loans executives before the crash of the industry to catch up to @entity81 who had been outflanking them in raising money*****0
the @entity5 were , and have continued to , losing their traditional base of campaign support -- organized labor -- which had been a central source of campaign muscle since the 1930s , providing money and campaign assistance during campaigns*****1
without organized labor to serve as their foundation and with the pressure for raising private funds increasing , many @entity5 concluded they needed business by their side*****0
democrats running for president have made the same kind of choices*****0
in 2008 , @entity48 disappointed many supporters upon becoming the first president to abandon the @entity104 public finance system for campaigns altogether , preferring to raise money himself for the general campaign*****0
while small donors were enormously important to his victories , so too were business and @entity12 executives*****0
at the height of the financial crash , when public sentiment had clearly turned against @entity12 , the administration agreed to a financial regulation bill ( @entity117 ) that was structured in such a way as to give powerful interests more than enough opportunity to limit the bite over the coming years*****0
@entity12 , with an army of counsel , succeeded in eroding the impact of the legislation*****0
not only does the acceptance of our campaign finance system limit the policy choices @entity5 can make , but it also greatly damages the party 's brand name*****1
as the @entity135 reported , the scandal that might bring down @entity134 @entity21 sen. @entity133 is the first involving large scale super pac donations*****0
at the heart of the story is almost $ 600,000 that physician @entity139 gave to @entity140 , possibly in exchange for favors*****0
this is not simply some sort of accommodation of @entity5 to the corporate system*****0
they do n't have much of a choice*****0
without these funds , they wo n't be able to compete*****1
in this election cycle , independent campaign donors are causing a huge stir*****0
in conservative circles , the @entity155 brothers and their allies are throwing around enormous amounts of money to candidates who will support their deregulatory agenda*****0
individual donors such as @entity164 gambling magnate @entity163 are causing ripples every time candidates speak , pressuring them to adjust their agenda*****0
@entity5 have found their own magnates for political support , such as @entity170 and @entity171*****0
this is why campaign finance reform is so important , without @entity175 changing the fundamental dynamics , there wo n't be much room for populism to thrive*****1
even if @entity5 select someone like a @entity0 as their candidate or @entity13 decides to move sharply to the left on economic policy , there wo n't be much room for reform when the time of governance actually starts*****1
the @entity21 needs @entity12 more than it needs to take a stand against @entity12*****0
those are the facts on the ground*****0
if @entity5 really want to take on @entity12 and tackle economic inequality , they first have to bring about reform of the campaign finance system*****1
if campaigns were publicly funded or there were more stringent limits on independent expenditures , @entity12 would have much more trouble achieving disproportionate influence*****0
reform could level the playing field*****0
more often than not , campaign finance reform is an issue that gets sidetracked with little more than some pro forma words of support*****0
a more populist economic agenda that revolved around progressive taxation and substantial public assistance to strengthen the middle class can only work in a different kind of political system*****0
if things stay the same , @entity5 can only continue to win elections by turning to their corporate and financial base of support .*****0
