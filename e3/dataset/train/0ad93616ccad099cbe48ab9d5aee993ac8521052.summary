( @entity3 ) the powers of @entity2 's all - star superheroes go a bit wobbly in " @entity5 : age of @entity7*****1
" faced with the daunting prospect of topping the surprise and excitement of 2012 's @entity5 , the third highest - grossing film of all time , writer - director @entity8 mixes some brooding down - time in with the abundant spectacle*****1
to be sure , series junkies will get their fix from the sheer massiveness of the exploits , but at least two of the big action scenes are lackluster , while the climax and resolution could have been worked out in more complex , less rote ways , so as to further increase intrigue and anticipation for " @entity5 : @entity27 1 and 2 , " already scheduled for release in may of 2018 and 2019 , respectively*****1
not that any of this will matter much , since the pent - up excitement among the enormous international fan base is so intense that nothing will keep the summer 's presumed biggest franchise blockbuster from soaring to and beyond the one - billion dollar threshold internationally*****0
hands - on producer @entity35 and his associates have built a cinematic empire quite unprecedented in @entity39 history , a veritable solar system of staggeringly profitable individual franchises unified by the overpowering collective force of the @entity5*****0
so while sideline enterprises like the new " @entity46 " tv series continue to pop up , the company can be so confident in the enduring appeal of its theatrical mainstays that it recently published a release schedule for its remaining big - gun commercial titles from now through the end of the decade*****0
at this point , no one would be willing to bet on when a sense of terminal deja vu might set in to bring it all to an end , and @entity59 can plan its main events years ahead*****0
in the meantime , the key points of interest surround how many surprises and twists can be wrung from a format and set of expectations that demand great fealty from core fans ; any significant deviations are taken as personal betrayals by the hardest - core geeks*****0
last summer , " @entity76 " showed that @entity2 could play it a bit more fast and loose than it generally does , but the big - name franchises still seem sacrosanct*****0
and so it is with " @entity5 : age of @entity7 , " which at moments takes a peek down some shadowy side roads but ends up mostly zooming along the main highway to deliver what the audience wants rather than something even a little bit different*****1
picking up where last year 's " captain america : winter soldier " left off , the new film , without preamble , dives right in to show the @entity5 dispatching the remnants of the nasty @entity92 organization in a hectically and indifferently staged forest combat scene that leaves @entity94 / @entity94 ( @entity95 ) worse for wear while also introducing two new adversaries , twins @entity99 and @entity100 ( @entity98 and @entity102 )*****0
@entity104 allows for some passably amusing scenes of the heroes blowing off steam : the favorite party trick of @entity109 ( @entity110 ) is to challenge all comers to lift up his hammer ; @entity116 / @entity115 ( @entity117 ) and @entity113 / @entity113 ( @entity114 ) pursue a little mating dance in which her amorous interest is predicated upon his retaining his human rather than superhero form ; and @entity122 / @entity122 ( @entity123 ) and @entity124 / @entity124 ( @entity125 ) take stock of the advances their old @entity130 nemesis @entity128 ( @entity129 ) appears to be making in the artificial intelligence department , specifically with the most sophisticated humanoid ever devised , @entity7 ( voiced with marvelous robotic nuance by @entity134 )*****0
what 's behind @entity137 ' risky move to release nine movies @entity7 is a cool and sophisticated creation ; what he lacks , of course , is a heart , which is what makes him such an imposing villain*****0
a sleekly designed robot you might even call handsome , he makes an excellent intellectual and smart - ass sparring partner for @entity122 , but when he first appears , he 's still on training wheels*****0
however , he does recruit @entity152 and @entity100 to his cause , an easy matter since @entity122 killed their parents*****0
he 's not yet entirely ready to conquer the universe but , in their first skirmish with him , the @entity5 are sufficiently outclassed to begin worrying*****0
could ' @entity161 ' open at $ 500 million ? licking their wounds at the " safe house " of @entity94 's farm , the @entity5 go into a funk*****0
the impatient @entity109 quickly takes off " to find answers , " @entity113 resists @entity116 's desire to get something physical cooking between them ; @entity122 , lamenting that " @entity7 is tryng to tear us apart , " consults with old cohort @entity173 ( @entity175 , briefly ) , while @entity178 's @entity177 , playing @entity94 's stand - by - your - man wife , is stuck with the ( intentionally ? ) funniest line of dialogue in the film : " you know i totally support your avenging*****0
" while some of his partners wallow in disarray , @entity124 heads for @entity188 , where the next evolutionary step is to emerge via a device called " the cradle , " which will hatch mass - produced android soldiers that will pave the way for @entity7 's world domination*****0
but a major chase through the city involving a runaway subway train falls flat due to basic conceptual silliness and poor action continuity*****0
of course , the @entity5 ultimately get it together to do the kind of butt - kicking they 're supposed to do , and a very welcome addition to the team comes in the form of the android called @entity208*****0
red - faced and green - garbed , @entity208 is given a striking profile and overall presence by @entity211 ( heretofore limited in the @entity2 world to vocal work as @entity122 's computerized butler @entity215 ) , and it can be hoped , if not assumed , that this most intriguing character will play an even more important role in the final two @entity5 installments*****0
