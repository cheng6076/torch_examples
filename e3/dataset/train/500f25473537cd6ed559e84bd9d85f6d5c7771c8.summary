( @entity1 ) last month 's so - so jobs numbers confirm the challenges our economy still faces*****1
despite recent gains , only 126,000 jobs were added , the lowest since december 2013*****0
wages remain sluggish*****0
and unemployment may still be at 5.5 % , but there is wide concern among labor experts and economists that too much job growth is in part - time low - income work*****1
low - wage workers have been the hardest hit since the onset of the financial crisis , and low - wage jobs remain a fixture of the new economy*****1
nearly 60 % of the people in @entity24 's workforce are paid hourly and work part - time*****1
most part - time employees are doing low - wage work*****1
tackling this growing trend is complex*****0
but there is a simple step we can take to improve the conditions of low - wage workers today*****1
@entity33 should help low - wage workers gain access to predictable work schedules*****1
here is how this issue works : @entity24 's major fast - food chains , retailers and department stores use " just - in - time " scheduling to maximize profit , which in turn creates unstable and stressful work environments for low - wage workers*****1
this type of scheduling has increased dramatically because of sophisticated software that ties staffing to expected customer traffic*****1
algorithms , built on sales and economic data , provide real - time information for managers to make personnel adjustments*****1
not surprisingly , such haphazard scheduling wreaks havoc with low - wage workers*****1
hourly low - income workers endure significantly greater fluctuations in their hours and less predictability in how much they earn than full - time employees*****1
many do n't even know their weekly schedules until the last moment*****0
a @entity70 study found that 41 % of early career hourly workers and 47 % who work part - time received a week or less of notice of their work schedules*****1
imagine dealing with this as you are trying to earn a basic living , find reliable child care , get new vocational skills , or attend to medical needs*****0
women and workers of color most acutely struggle with this practice*****0
women comprise over two - thirds of the nearly 20 million workers in low - wage jobs like home health care , fast food work , and cash services*****1
similarly , a large proportion of minorities work low - wage jobs*****1
nearly 50 % of african - americans and @entity97 receive their hours with a week or less notice*****0
by comparison , almost 40 % of whites receive weekly notice*****0
minorities also have much less of an ability to control their hours*****0
only 10 % of @entity97 and 12 % of black workers reported being able to set their hours within certain limits or freely*****0
within this same context , 18 % of whites said they could*****0
child care is the primary casualty of just - in - time scheduling*****1
because of erratic shifts , child care centers often ca n't accommodate a working mother 's schedule*****0
many must attend to informal arrangements , which by nature are unstable and unreliable*****0
traditional economic safeguards have offered little help to these workers*****0
unions , for example , have provided little protection against just - in - time scheduling because of their nascent role in the service economy*****1
real solutions exist*****0
states and cities are enacting laws to address scheduling abuses*****0
@entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 previously introduced promising legislation*****0
and in december , @entity138 became the first jurisdiction to pass a " retail worker bill of rights*****0
" this ordinance limits how chain stores can alter their employees ' schedules*****0
still , there is no substitute for federal action*****0
too many people work in states with little protection*****0
@entity152 ignores the problem because congressional republicans have shown little interest in the plight of low - wage workers*****1
last summer , the schedules that @entity159 was introduced in @entity33*****1
according to the @entity161 , the bill would provide workers the right to request and receive predictable work schedules , receive compensation for sudden scheduling changes , and not fear retaliation if they request scheduling accommodations from their boss*****1
although the bill expired last session it will likely be reintroduced*****0
and yet the bill will most likely not pass*****0
congressional republicans have demonstrated they are more interested in unraveling worker protections under the guise of supporting economic growth*****0
conservatives should embrace this work - schedule legislation*****1
the bill protects families and allows them to attend to their many obligations , not just work*****0
protecting shift workers is likewise good for business*****0
studies show that workers who exercise greater control over their hours are happier and more efficient*****0
conversely , just - in - time scheduling increases worker turnover and hurts worker satisfaction*****1
while @entity152 stalls , it 's everyday @entity24 who are hurt*****0
it 's the single mom in @entity196 working as a @entity198 cashier who 's juggling work and childcare for her kids*****0
it 's the @entity203 's line cook in @entity204 who needs reliable shifts to make her dialysis treatments*****0
it 's the stock man at an @entity211 fulfillment center in @entity212 who ca n't get his son to pre-algebra tutoring because of his erratic shifts*****0
our leaders have the unique responsibility to protect @entity24 and attend to the critical economic challenges of our time*****1
even with the weaker - than - expected jobs report we know our overall economy is improving , yet income - inequality is deepening*****1
@entity33 must endorse a recovery that 's inclusive , livable , and one that enables every family to balance competing obligations*****0
they can start by passing legislation that better protects shift workers from arbitrary and unpredictable scheduling practices .*****0
