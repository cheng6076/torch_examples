@entity1 , @entity4 ( @entity5 ) the @entity1 deputy who shot and killed a man instead of using his taser now faces a manslaughter charge . video shows reserve deputy @entity8 announcing he is going to deploy his taser after an undercover weapons sting on april 2 , but then shooting @entity10 in the back with a handgun . in a written statement , @entity1 district attorney @entity13 said @entity8 is charged with second - degree manslaughter involving culpable negligence . it 's a felony charge that could land the volunteer deputy in prison for up to four years if he 's found guilty . @entity20 , an attorney who represents @entity8 , said the shooting was an " excusable homicide .
