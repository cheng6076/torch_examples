( @entity1 ) @entity0 knows what death looks like . as a physician , he has seen patients die in hospitals , hooked to morphine drips and overcome with anxiety . he has watched dying drag on for weeks or months as terrified relatives stand by helplessly . recently , however , his thoughts about how seriously ill people die have become personal . @entity0 was diagnosed in 2013 with a rare form of metastatic cancer . to remove the cancer , surgeons took out parts of his pancreas and liver , as well as his entire spleen and gallbladder . the operation was successful but @entity0 , 48 , knows there 's a strong chance the disease will return . and if he gets to a point where there 's nothing more medicine can do , he wants to be able to control when and how his life ends . " it 's very real for me , " said @entity0 , who lives in @entity31 , @entity32 " this could be my own issue a year from now . " that 's one of the reasons @entity0 joined a @entity32 lawsuit last month seeking to let doctors prescribe lethal medications to certain patients who want to hasten death . if he were given only months to live , @entity0 said , he ca n't say for certain whether he would take them . " but i want to be able to make that choice , " he said . the right - to - die movement has gained renewed momentum in @entity32 and around the nation following the highly publicized death of an @entity51 woman with brain cancer . @entity53 , 29 , moved to @entity54 to take advantage of its " @entity57 " law and died in november after taking a fatal dose of barbiturates prescribed by her doctor . the @entity32 lawsuit asks the court to protect physicians from liability if they prescribe lethal medications to patients who are both terminally ill and mentally competent to decide their fate . the lawsuit argues that while it is against the law in @entity32 for anyone to assist in another 's suicide , these cases are not suicides . rather , the suit argues , they are choices by a dying person on how his or her life should end and decisions about one 's own body protected under the state constitution . separately , two @entity32 state senators have proposed a bill that would allow doctors to prescribe lethal medication to certain terminally ill adults . three states -- @entity54 , @entity86 and @entity87 -- already have laws allowing physician - assisted deaths . courts in @entity92 and @entity93 also have ruled that aid in dying is legal , and a suit was also recently filed in @entity97 . legislation is pending in several other states . @entity100 , an attorney on several of the court cases , is also spearheading the @entity32 lawsuit . this time , she and her legal team decided to include among the plaintiffs two doctors with life - threatening illnesses , @entity107 and a retired @entity109 obstetrician . physicians " have a very deep and broad understanding about what the journey to death can be like , " said @entity110 , executive director of the @entity111 .
