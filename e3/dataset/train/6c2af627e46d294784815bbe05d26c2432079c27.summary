( @entity0 ) looting , fires and violence descended on @entity3*****0
like most who know and love that city , i was heartbroken*****0
i was once a cop in @entity3*****0
police , trying to save their city last weekend , were blamed both for doing too little and for doing too much*****1
the ghetto , and i 'm talking class and not race , was on full display by monday*****0
the whole nation saw beautiful @entity3 at its worst*****0
the protests started in response to the death of @entity17 in police hands*****0
we still do n't know what happened to @entity17*****0
something bad happened*****0
there 's an investigation*****0
maybe the investigation should be going faster*****0
but maybe rushing the investigation would compromise prosecution*****0
( and forced testimony ca n't be used in prosecution ; police officers too have constitutional rights as criminal defendants*****0
) i do n't know*****0
here 's the thing : police officers who were n't there do n't know what happened to @entity17*****0
if there are criminally guilty cops , police have no problem with justice*****1
but those who caused destruction on monday had little , if anything , to do with @entity17 protests*****0
they were , as the mayor put it , thugs*****0
call them what you will , normally what happens in the hood stays in the hood*****0
those who cut fire hoses and burned down homes and businesses ? police deal with them every day , literally*****0
those criminals did n't just appear on monday , and they wo n't be gone tomorrow*****0
they live there , without jobs , education , mainstream social skills , or hope*****0
they do n't come from stable families*****0
they do n't go to church*****0
most violent criminals are actively or passively involved in the drug trade*****0
in @entity3 this year -- just like last year and just like next year -- police will arrest tens of thousands of poor black men , mostly on drug charges*****1
from the same pool , 200 will be shot and killed*****0
another 200 will do the killing*****0
these are communities , like the @entity3 's @entity78 , in which more than 10 % of men are murdered*****0
if all of @entity82 had homicide levels found in parts of @entity3 , there would be over 300,000 murders per year ( as opposed to the still shamefully high 12,000 homicides in @entity82 )*****0
and yet some continue to think of police as the main problem rather than part of the solution*****1
but @entity3 is not @entity92*****0
the police department is 50 % non-white*****0
the mayor is black*****0
so is the police commissioner*****0
the city is 65 % @entity97*****0
so imagine you 're a young white cop , as i was , in a rough neighborhood*****0
a nice retired @entity102 - @entity82 gentleman calls 911 because the kids in front of his house , also black , are rowdy , breaking bottles , selling drugs , and otherwise being disrespectful*****0
just out of the police academy , i pulled up to countless of these situations*****0
what to do ? usually i stopped , stared , and they moved on*****0
sometimes i would get out of my car*****0
but i should n't have to*****0
we all played by the same rules*****0
it 's about respect*****0
sometimes i would ask politely*****0
sometimes i had to order rudely*****0
sometimes i would ask for @entity117*****0
sometimes i would frisk , search , or arrest*****0
that 's what cops do*****0
every day*****0
that 's what i did*****0
i had to*****0
that was my job*****0
ultimately police are in a no - win situation*****1
and when things go wrong , they go wrong fast*****0
people run*****0
there are fights*****0
guns*****0
people get hurt*****0
sometimes people die*****0
sometimes -- not very often -- it 's the police officer 's fault*****0
but even if there were no racist or brutal cops -- if every cop were a polite , fit , college - educated , bilingual , @entity102 - @entity82 gentleman or woman -- this would n't solve the greater problems of the ghetto or even police abuse*****1
police abuse has less to do with race than poverty and class*****1
and police will never solve the problems of absent parents , mass incarceration , or a violence culture centered around the economics of drug prohibition*****0
even so , rather than face up to our problems , we calls for the cops to do something , anything*****0
yes , bad cops need to be punished*****0
but it 's too easy to blame police for all our problems*****0
problems police did not cause and can not solve*****0
and then when a cop makes a mistake , as one inevitably will , we jump on all police with a confident smugness and unbecoming glee*****0
the problems in policing mirror the problems of society*****0
we can and should improve police*****0
the best way to do that is to improve society*****0
true justice requires us to look both inward for blame and outward to the suffering around us*****0
the worst thing we could do is nothing at all .*****0
