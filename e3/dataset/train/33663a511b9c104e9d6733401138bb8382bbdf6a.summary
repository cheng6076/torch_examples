( @entity1 ) president @entity0 never lost his ardor for the @entity3 to remain united during the @entity4 . in his second inaugural address he attempted to salve the nation with an eloquent summation of his philosophy and plans for putting it into practice . " with malice toward none , with charity for all , with firmness in the right as @entity17 gives us to see the right , " he orated , " let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nations ' wounds , to care for him who shall have borne the battle for his widow and his orphan , to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations . " the spirit of @entity0 's second inaugural was self - evident on april 9 , 1865 -- 150 years ago -- when @entity35 gen. @entity34 dramatically surrendered his approximately 28,000 troops to @entity38 general @entity37 at @entity39 ( @entity40 ) in @entity41 . over 600,000 @entity3 -- northerners and @entity43 alike -- had perished in the bloody @entity4 . but the carnage was now about to end . the historic meeting between @entity37 and @entity34 began with pleasantries about the weather and their mutual service in the @entity49 . the good fellowship was palpable . @entity34 , in fact , had to abruptly remind the chatty @entity37 about the diplomatic business at hand . after all , they were at @entity39 to hash out terms of surrender . @entity37 purposely ended up being generous to @entity35 soldiers . they would be paroled , not condemned to prison camps . rebel officers were even allowed to maintain their sidearms . personal property of @entity43 would now be respected . even rations were provided by @entity37 for @entity34 's hungry soldiers . it was @entity66 and in the spirit of @entity69 reconciliation @entity37 ordered that no celebration occur within @entity71 ranks .

over 600,000 @entity3 -- northerners and @entity43 alike -- had perished in the bloody @entity4*****0
but the carnage was now about to end*****0
the historic meeting between @entity37 and @entity34 began with pleasantries about the weather and their mutual service in the @entity49*****0
the good fellowship was palpable*****0
@entity34 , in fact , had to abruptly remind the chatty @entity37 about the diplomatic business at hand*****0
after all , they were at @entity39 to hash out terms of surrender*****0
@entity37 purposely ended up being generous to @entity35 soldiers*****0
they would be paroled , not condemned to prison camps*****0
rebel officers were even allowed to maintain their sidearms*****0
personal property of @entity43 would now be respected*****0
even rations were provided by @entity37 for @entity34 's hungry soldiers*****1

" the myth - making about @entity39 started from the moment @entity34 left the courthouse on his horse to travel to @entity80*****1
@entity81 had n't been easy for @entity34*****0
@entity84 from defeat , his own family property in @entity83 had been confiscated by @entity38 forces ( converted into a @entity38 cemetery with lines of white crosses on the lawn )*****0
all 11,000 acres of his @entity41 land holdings had been stripped from him by the @entity3 government*****0
with no real home , @entity34 rode to @entity80 , depressed and destitute , rendezvousing with his sick wife @entity94 at a spare apartment*****0

after being present at @entity34 's dramatic surrender at @entity39 , @entity111 , a battle - fatigued @entity35 , laid down his rifle and journeyed back to red - clay , @entity114 , traveling mainly on foot , passing ragged clusters of rebel amputees , many hobbling on bayonet crutches , others with arms or heads swathed in bandages and all heading in the same direction : home*****1
upon arriving in @entity126 , a weary @entity111 found the @entity35 railroad - city smoldered in ruin , the handiwork of gen. @entity131 's " scorched earth policy*****1

) upon leaving @entity126 , @entity111 continued walking south , anxious for his kinfolk*****0
unfortunately , he returned to @entity140 only to learn that his father had died and that the family farm was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy*****0
one suspects @entity145 , the main character of novelist @entity148 's " @entity147 , " spoke for the battle - hardened @entity4 veterans like @entity111 , when he lamented that , " what you have lost will not be returned to you*****0
it will always be lost*****0
you 're left with only your scars to mark the void*****0
all you can do is go on or not*****0
but if you go on , it 's knowing you carry scars with you*****0
" as we reflect on the sesquicentennial of @entity34 's surrender at that forlorn @entity41 courthouse , today marvelously maintained by the @entity163 , we recognize that the scars of the @entity4 are still with us*****1
the @entity166 divide still exists*****0
almost all the old @entity35 are now considered " @entity173 " ( @entity174 ) , while the @entity167 are " blue " ( @entity168 ) -- a residual variation of @entity170 versus @entity171 of the @entity4 era*****0
while the old spiritual " @entity178 " was sung by blacks in the hours following the @entity39 surrender , racism sadly continues to be a crippling national scourge*****0
while there no longer are beatings in @entity184 ( like in 1856 when @entity185 of @entity186 caned @entity187 of @entity188 on the @entity184 floor ) the gridlock on @entity191 in 2015 , the inability to get anything done , is similarly cold - cocking the spirit of our participatory democracy*****0
all @entity3 eyes should be fixated on @entity39 today*****1
the @entity40 house is our collective sanctuary of national healing*****0
as a public place , the @entity40 parlor remains small but the legacy which @entity37 and @entity34 made at the truce table is timeless in world history*****0
for while the scars of the monstrous @entity4 still remain , the wounds have closed since 1865 , in large part , because of the civility of @entity37 and @entity34*****0
with grace and dignity , these brave @entity209 generals gave righteous credence to @entity0 's " with malice toward none " finery .*****0
