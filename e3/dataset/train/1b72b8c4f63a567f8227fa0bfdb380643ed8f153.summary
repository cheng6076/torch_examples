( @entity2 ) a @entity1 committee concluded that full screening of airport employees nationwide would not lower the overall risk to the public , according to a report released monday . the report by the @entity1 's @entity9 said that full employee screening would not " appreciably increase the overall system - wide protection . " email your story ideas and tips to @entity16 . full physical screening of employees also " is incapable of determining a person 's motivations , attitudes and capabilities to cause harm , among other limitations . " " no single measure can provide broad - spectrum protection against risks or adversaries , " the report said . " therefore , risk - based , multi-layered security offers the greatest ability to mitigate risks through the application of flexible and unpredictable measures to protect commercial aviation . " the @entity1 and most airports could not afford 100 % employee screening , the report said . only two major airports in the @entity39 -- @entity41 and @entity42 -- require employees to be screened through metal detectors , a @entity2 investigation found earlier this year . as a result of the report , @entity1 secretary @entity45 announced immediate actions , including criminal background checks every two years for all airport aviation workers , screening of airline and airport employees traveling as passengers , reduction of access points to secure areas at all airports and increased random screening of aviation employees . @entity45 requested the @entity1 study after a @entity63 ramp worker and passenger at @entity65 were arrested in december for allegedly smuggling guns onto flights to @entity68 . since the incident , the airport has hired private security to check the bags of employees when they show up for work and has increased overall security . " immediately following the incident in december 2014 , @entity1 increased the random and unpredictable screening of aviation workers at various airport access points to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities , " @entity45 said in a statement . sen. @entity82 called @entity45 's announcement " a prompt response and a significant first step to closing the gaping loopholes in airport security , especially with regard to reducing access points and enhancing criminal background checks . " specifically , the @entity1 report said employee vetting should be strengthened by " updating the list of disqualifying criminal offenses , instituting continuous activity monitoring through the inclusion of additional @entity97 ( @entity97 ) and @entity98 data sources , and maintaining a national database of airport employees whose credentials have been revoked for cause . " in addition , the @entity1 should expand the collection of domestic intelligence , which would include monitoring social media , and expand national reward programs to encourage employees to report security issues , the report said . " although there is no perfect security system , the multiple layers -- which can be routinely enhanced or modified -- provide an effective means to secure passengers , employees and facilities , " the report said . it also recommended increased surveillance of employees who work inside baggage rooms and cargo areas . @entity2 revealed this month that passengers filed 30,621 claims from 2010 to 2014 for valuables that were missing from luggage . the @entity1 report agreed with a 2008 @entity98 study that found random screening was more cost - effective than mandatory airport employee screening . the committee that conducted the @entity1 study consisted of representatives from the @entity1 , airports , airlines , airline pilots , aviation security and law enforcement . rep. @entity139 , @entity140 - @entity68 and chairman of the @entity142 on @entity1 , said , " as threats to aviation security continue to evolve , it is critical that the @entity1 , as well as the airport community , are adequately prepared to mitigate insider threats . i look forward to having a meaningful dialogue with airport stakeholders and the @entity1 on what can be done , going forward , to improve employee vetting and screening for those with access to sensitive and sterile parts of airports . " rep. @entity155 , @entity156 - @entity68 , a ranking member of the @entity157 , said the report makes it clear that the " @entity1 must do more to neutralize the insider threat and prevent security breaches like we saw in december . " " screening every single employee may not be a cure - all solution , but every single employee should come to work every day with reason to expect that they 'll face random screening and inspections , " she said . @entity171 , security director at @entity41 , told @entity2 , " we support the findings of the committee and agree that there is no single solution in mitigating the insider threat , however we will continue our employee screening program as we believe that physical screening is a critical component to a layered security program . " @entity2 's @entity182 contributed to this report .
