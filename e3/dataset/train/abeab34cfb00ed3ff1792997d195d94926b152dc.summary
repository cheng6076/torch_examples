( @entity0 ) thousands of @entity2 and @entity3 refugees trapped in the @entity5 refugee camp have suffered what can only be described as untold indignities . but while the story is in itself tragic , it is the individual lives at the heart of the camp that make the imperative for humanitarian action so compelling . i encountered two such individuals on my mission to @entity18 -- @entity20 and @entity21 -- tiny , vulnerable infants who were taken from @entity5 in recent days , a place that was described last week by the @entity25 @entity24 ban ki - moon as " the deepest circle of hell .
