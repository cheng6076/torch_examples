@entity3 ( @entity4 ) until recently , if you sat in church on sunday mornings , pollsters could predict where you stood on same - sex marriage . what a difference a decade makes . in 2003 , when the @entity9 became the country 's first to legalize same - sex marriage , less than 30 % of religiously affiliated @entity12 supported gays ' and lesbians ' right to wed. by 2014 , that number had climbed to 47 % , according to a survey conducted by the @entity17 . that 's more than the 45 % who said they opposed same - sex nuptials . the margin is small but statistically significant , said @entity23 , ceo of @entity17 , because of the exceptionally large pool of respondents : 40,000 adult @entity12 . ( eight percent refused to answer or said they did n't know their stance on same - sex marriage . ) according to @entity17 's poll , there are now more people of faith who favor marriage equality than stand against it , a dramatic turn in one of this country 's most divisive debates and a generational shift with the potential to sweep through everything from the wedding industry to the 2016 presidential race . " there 's been a huge swing in the last decade , " said @entity23 . " there are now big , mainstream groups on both sides of the debate . " if the @entity12 @entity9 has been paying attention , it likely saw this trend coming . each time the high court has considered a case related to same - sex marriage , the pile of amicus briefs from religious groups supporting gay rights has inched a little taller , and the crowds protesting outside their grand marble steps has gradually grown more diverse . on tuesday , for example , as the @entity9 hears oral arguments in @entity63 v. @entity64 , a case widely expected to produce a landmark ruling on same - sex marriage , an interfaith coalition of clergy led by the dean of @entity3 's @entity71 is planning to march in support of lgbt rights . " i join with many across the spectrum of @entity12 faith communities in my hope that the @entity9 's ruling will permit same - sex marriage in all 50 states , " the very rev. @entity75 , the cathedral 's dean , said in a statement .
