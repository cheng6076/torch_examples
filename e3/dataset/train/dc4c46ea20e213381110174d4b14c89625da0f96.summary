( @entity2 ) pope @entity1 has accepted the resignation of bishop @entity4 , who remained on the job for years after becoming the highest - ranking @entity7 official convicted in connection with the church 's long - running sex abuse scandal , the @entity0 announced tuesday . @entity4 , who led the diocese of @entity13 - @entity12 , @entity14 , was found guilty in 2012 of failure to report suspected child abuse . the case was tried by a judge instead of by jury because prosecutors wanted to protect the young victims ' anonymity . @entity4 was convicted of one count but not a misdemeanor charge he 'd also faced . he was put on two years ' probation but was not forced to spend time in jail or pay a fine , according to the @entity29 . two charges against his diocese were dropped . at the time of his conviction , @entity4 said , according to @entity2 affiliate @entity34 : " i truly regret and am sorry for the hurt these events have caused . " @entity38 prosecutor @entity37 said the conviction and penalty , which included starting a $ 10,000 fund for sexual abuse counseling and mandatory training for church officials on how to report abuse , would have positive ramifications . " we can be assured now that if an allegation of child abuse comes to the attention of the diocese of @entity13 - @entity12 , there will be no hesitation to report it immediately to the proper authorities , " @entity37 said . the case against @entity4 revolved around his diocese 's dealings with @entity58 , an @entity59 , @entity14 , priest who pleaded guilty in august 2012 to five child pornography charges . church officials found disturbing images on @entity58 's computer but did n't notify police until nearly five months later , prosecutors said . in those interceding months , the priest kept on working . and @entity4 kept his job as bishop , even after his 2012 conviction . the official website of the @entity7 diocese of @entity13 - @entity12 still listed him as its bishop tuesday morning . cardinal @entity72 , who took over the abuse - shaken @entity74 archdiocese and has become one of the @entity1 's point men in the @entity77 , has acknowledged the inconsistency that someone who would n't be allowed to teach sunday school was still running an @entity77 diocese . " it 's a question that the @entity0 needs to address urgently , " @entity72 said in a " @entity83 " interview in november . " there 's a recognition of that ... from @entity1 . " @entity88 -- a professor at @entity89 , a @entity7 university in @entity90 -- said it " does n't look very urgent " that a decision came down only now , nearly three years after the conviction and five months after @entity72 's comments . several factors may have played a role in the delay , including views from lawyers or power players at the @entity0 , who may be reluctant to cast blame at high - level officials who do n't report allegations quickly enough to government authorities . but the timing of the announcement may make sense given that it comes weeks after @entity1 came under fire for the installation of a new bishop in @entity111 , @entity112 , despite protesters ' claims he was complicit in sexual abuse cases there .

" having this resignation and putting right one of the more visible injustices on this , especially in the @entity77 , i think this is a typical @entity1 way to reinstall confidence . " now that the case has been addressed , the @entity13 - @entity12 diocese has a new leader : @entity13 archbishop @entity128 . under the @entity1 's directive , @entity128 will be the @entity13 diocese 's apostolic administrator , in addition to his regular responsibilities in @entity13 , until a permanent bishop is appointed , according to an announcement on the diocese 's website . " i pray that the coming weeks and months will be a time of grace and healing for the @entity142 , " @entity128 said in an open letter to parishioners . " all of us , who are privileged to serve in leadership for the @entity146 , do so for only a season . it is not our church , but @entity150 's @entity146 . " @entity88 , the @entity89 professor , predicted that the shuffling at the western @entity14 diocese will be " very well received , " though some may question why it took so long . " it 's not just that it 's late , " @entity88 said , " but it 's that @entity1 could have been more explicit . " to that point , the co-director of @entity160 asked for more elaboration than the @entity0 's one - line announcement that @entity1 accepted the resignation " in accordance with ... @entity166 . " @entity170 , from the watchdog group that documents the @entity169 's abuse crisis , called @entity4 's removal " a good step but just the beginning . " " the pope must show that this decision represents a meaningful shift in papal practice -- that it signals a new era in bishop accountability , " @entity174 said . " ... what no pope has done to date is publicly confirm that he removed a culpable bishop because of his failure to make children 's safety his first priority . we urge @entity1 to issue such a statement immediately . " @entity2 's @entity190 contributed to this report .
