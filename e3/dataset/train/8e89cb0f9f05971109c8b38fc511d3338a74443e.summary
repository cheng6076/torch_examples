@entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 ( @entity3 ) by the time you reach the outskirts of @entity2 's capital , even the roads are showing signs of the sheer magnitude of this earthquake -- and the enormity of the task awaiting a country struggling to come to terms with devastation and tragedy*****1
the main highway that heads east out of @entity19 shows massive cracks , the tarmac torn apart by the force of saturday 's huge tremor*****0
one lane is bisected by gaping , half - meter ( 1.5 feet ) fissures*****0
they 've been filled in with rubble and dirt , allowing passage for those desperate citizens to reach their families in outlying districts*****0
it takes an age , though , picking our way along damaged roads to a small village community , @entity0*****1
it is only 30 kilometers ( 20 miles ) east of @entity19 but the journey takes almost two hours -- and the travel times likely to be compounded the farther out from the city people go*****1
the community is off the main highway , down a dirt track that quickly finds itself winding through forested slopes and terraced fields*****0
they farm corn here , and millet , and vegetables*****0
compared to the capital , and the regions west of @entity19 and closer to the epicenter , the people here were relatively lucky*****1
still , passing through villages it 's clear that damage has been suffered*****0
in @entity0 a village official walks quickly by , telling us over his shoulder that 90 % of the houses are currently uninhabitable*****1
some are still standing , but seem precarious and the residents are too scared of aftershocks to move back inside*****0
patchy reports have filtered through of entire villages leveled by the quake or engulfed by landslides*****0
@entity70 , 62 , is alive , but surveys the desolation the quake has wreaked on her life*****0
we find her sitting as close as she can to the ruins of the house that she built with her late husband*****0
she 's petite and frail but hardened by life*****0
her leg , bandaged and suppurating , is stretched out in front of her*****0
she periodically flicks at the flies that have settled on the blood - and pus - soaked dressing*****0
" i just want to cry , all i feel is hurt " she says , showing us where she was the moment the earthquake struck*****0
@entity70 's house was one of the bigger ones in this region , a rare two - story structure*****0
she and her husband built it together , a lifetime ago*****0
he died years ago , but her extended family lived here with her until saturday*****0
she , along with her daughter - in - law were indoors when the quake struck , and she was lucky to make it out onto a small wooden balcony*****0
another tremor brought this down and she had to extricate herself from the rubble and crawl up an embankment*****0
the younger woman , trapped in the wreckage after the roof fell in on her , eventually clawed her way out*****0
she was transported by motorbike -- few here have motorized transportation ; most walk -- to a missionary hospital in a neighboring village , 12 kilometers ( 7.4 miles ) away from here*****0
now she is back , wondering what the next step for her is*****0
throughout this region , there have been small landslides and people have been industrious in clearing rubble from the roads*****0
there is little sign of aid having made it out here*****0
out of necessity people are back working their fields*****0
near the road a family makes lunch in the open as their house was destroyed*****0
elsewhere in @entity0 , other unfortunate families count the cost of the disaster*****1
@entity138 , 31 , lost his only daughter , @entity139 in the quake , who was killed as their house collapsed*****0
she was 2 years old*****0
he was working when the quake hit , tilling the fields like so many in @entity145 , and ran back to his house after quickly realizing the force of the tremor*****0
" i started digging with my hands , " he says , still very much in shock , but remembering his frantic efforts among the remains of his damaged home*****0
" and i saw her , blood was trickling from her mouth and she was covered in cuts*****0
" all he has left now is a picture in his phone ; a chubby - faced toddler , wearing oversized sunglasses*****0

" we are not safe ... we are so scared , " @entity172 tells me*****0
and all this a mere 90 minutes drive from the capital*****0
there are parts of @entity2 so remote it takes days to reach under normal circumstances -- there are villages here that one can only reach on foot and it is those areas that were hardest hit*****0
these are the places where aid has yet to arrive , and where no one really knows the full extent of human loss or how many tragedies like the one at this home have unfolded*****0
