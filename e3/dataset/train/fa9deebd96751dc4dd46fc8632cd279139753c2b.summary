( @entity3 ) a @entity1 student who was accused of rape is suing the @entity5 school for allowing his accuser to publicly brand him a " serial rapist " according to the lawsuit , @entity8 was cleared of responsibility in @entity12 's 2013 rape claim , as well as others that came to light after @entity12 went public with her allegations in various media interviews . her case drew national attention after she started carrying a mattress around campus to protest the school 's handling of the complaint , saying she hoped to show how " flawed " the university disciplinary system is when it comes to sexual misconduct cases . @entity3 does not usually name individuals in sexual assault cases , but in this instance , both parties have spoken publicly about their experience . they have also both said in separate interviews with the @entity35 that @entity8 was cleared of responsibility in a disciplinary hearing . @entity8 , an international student from @entity38 , filed a federal discrimination lawsuit last week against the school ; its president , @entity43 ; and the visual arts professor who oversaw @entity12 's mattress project , " carry that weight , " as part of her senior thesis . the lawsuit alleges the defendants violated @entity8 's right to an education free of gender - based discrimination by allowing @entity12 to speak out against him after he had been cleared of wrongdoing . during an april 2014 news conference at @entity1 , sen. @entity55 stood alongside @entity12 as she called @entity8 a " serial rapist " and said she fears for her safety while he 's still on campus . the harassment continued , the lawsuit claims , when @entity1 visual arts professor @entity62 let @entity12 " transform her personal vendetta " into a " @entity1 - sponsored calumny " by supporting " @entity65 " for her senior thesis , allowing her to earn school credit through " this outrageous display of harassment and defamation . " @entity43 also commented on the case in a 2014 @entity72 profile of @entity12 , now a senior at @entity1 . " this is a person who is one of my students , and i care about all of my students . and when one of them feels that she has been a victim of mistreatment , i am affected by that . this is all very painful . " the defendants " had the power , as well as the legal and contractual obligation " to protect @entity8 , who is also a senior , the lawsuit claims . " by refusing to protect @entity8 , @entity1 first became a silent bystander and then turned into an active supporter of a fellow student 's harassment campaign by institutionalizing it and heralding it . " @entity1 declined to comment on the lawsuit . the school also declined to confirm the outcome of @entity8 's disciplinary proceedings . " as we have said consistently , we do not and have not commented on individual students or disciplinary cases not only because of federal student privacy law , but also because of our ethical responsibility to ensure all current and future students have confidence that the university will never publicly discuss private matters they share when interacting with counselors and support staff , the campus disciplinary process or other resources we provide to them , " spokesman @entity99 said in statement . @entity62 also declined to comment on the lawsuit . the case has produced dueling narratives from both sides in national media outlets . the most recent came from @entity8 in a @entity122 article titled , " @entity123 : i did n't rape her , " in which he shared a long exchange of @entity129 messages to support his claim that their sex was consensual . some of those exchanges were included in the lawsuit , but @entity12 told @entity3 they were taken out of context in the suit . she also balked at the idea that @entity8 would sue the school or her professor " for allowing me to make an art piece . " " it 's ridiculous that he would read it as a ' bullying strategy , ' especially given his continued public attempts to smear my reputation , when really it 's just an artistic expression of the personal trauma i 've experienced at @entity1 , " @entity12 wrote in an email . " if artists are not allowed to make art that reflects on our experiences , then how are we to heal ? " the project essentially consists of @entity12 carrying a twin - size mattress wherever she goes on campus , but not off campus . she 's allowed to accept help carrying the object but does not allow herself to ask for help . ​ @entity8 's complaint seeks damages to be determined at trial for harm to his reputation , loss of educational opportunities and future career prospects . @entity3 's @entity168 and @entity169 contributed to this report .
