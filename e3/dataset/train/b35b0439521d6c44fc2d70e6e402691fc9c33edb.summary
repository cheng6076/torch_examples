( @entity1 ) in this @entity0 , let us be reminded of what the word of @entity4 says about fair and living wages . @entity7 tells us : this is the kind of fast day i 'm after : to break the chains of injustice , get rid of exploitation in the workplace , free the oppressed , cancel debts . the @entity16 's announcement that the company is going to raise wages for 90,000 of its employees is a significant victory for fast - food cooks and cashiers and those of us who support them . by standing up together , fast - food workers are making it less acceptable for profitable companies like @entity33 's to pay wages so low that its workers are boxed into poverty . but this action , which would raise starting wages at 1,500 @entity16 - owned restaurants to at least $ 1 an hour more than the minimum wage set by local law , falls short in three important ways first , it leaves out the vast majority of @entity33 's workers . the announcement only affects 10 % of the @entity16 's restaurants in the @entity45 , ignoring the employees who work at franchised @entity33 's restaurants . that means hundreds of thousands of workers serving @entity50 and fries wo n't see a dollar more in their paychecks . @entity33 's claims that it has no responsibility for those franchises , but its workers , and the @entity58 , disagree . secondly , this raise is n't nearly enough . one dollar above the minimum wage is n't enough to make paying for groceries , rent and transportation much easier , especially coming from a company that makes nearly $ 5 billion a year in profits . it 's not enough for clothing or health care . it 's not enough , as people of my faith say , for those cooks and cashiers to afford their daily bread . thirdly , the raise does nothing to help workers have a voice in determining their workplace conditions . @entity33 's and other companies need to stop trying to prevent their workers from speaking out together in a union . they should respect workers ' right to collectively demand sensible schedules and such basics as adequate first aid kits , and not being compelled to work off the clock . we are at a turning point in @entity45 history . we are at a @entity94 . we are at the moment when forces come together to push this country forward toward the goal of a better life for all : sustainable wages , affordable health care , quality education , and , respect for workers ' right to stick together in unions so they can be heard . we are wining this fight , and the @entity16 's announcement is proof that the momentum is on our side . when all @entity33 's workers have more money in their pockets , they will inject money back into their neighborhoods , boosting the entire economy . instead of houses in foreclosure and hungry children , we would have a rising wage floor and thriving communities that support more jobs . today , thousands of @entity33 's workers live below the federal poverty line . many get help from government programs , especially food stamps , to make it week to week . whether we like it or not , our tax dollars help @entity33 's keep wages artificially low . this is n't just an economic issue . it 's a moral issue . i 've talked to workers at @entity33 's restaurants who say they have to skip meals because they do n't have enough money . the rev. @entity141 once said , " what good is having the right to sit at a lunch counter if you ca n't afford to buy a hamburger ? " it 's time for @entity33 's to make sure all the people who serve its burgers are paid enough to afford to eat them for dinner . but we are n't going to wait for divine intervention . we 're going to keep organizing and keep fighting until the workers at @entity16 , and every other fast - food restaurant , get what makes sense for their families and our communities : a $ 15 per hour wage and a path to form a union without interference or retaliation . @entity33 's took a small step forward by raising wages for a small minority of the people who run their stores . it 's time for the corporation to find a way to raise wages for everyone working in its restaurants so they can pay their bills , put some money back into their community , and expand prosperity and opportunity across our land .

( @entity1 ) in this @entity0 , let us be reminded of what the word of @entity4 says about fair and living wages*****0
@entity7 tells us : this is the kind of fast day i 'm after : to break the chains of injustice , get rid of exploitation in the workplace , free the oppressed , cancel debts*****0
the @entity16 's announcement that the company is going to raise wages for 90,000 of its employees is a significant victory for fast - food cooks and cashiers and those of us who support them*****1
by standing up together , fast - food workers are making it less acceptable for profitable companies like @entity33 's to pay wages so low that its workers are boxed into poverty*****1
but this action , which would raise starting wages at 1,500 @entity16 - owned restaurants to at least $ 1 an hour more than the minimum wage set by local law , falls short in three important ways first , it leaves out the vast majority of @entity33 's workers*****1
the announcement only affects 10 % of the @entity16 's restaurants in the @entity45 , ignoring the employees who work at franchised @entity33 's restaurants*****1
that means hundreds of thousands of workers serving @entity50 and fries wo n't see a dollar more in their paychecks*****0
@entity33 's claims that it has no responsibility for those franchises , but its workers , and the @entity58 , disagree*****1
secondly , this raise is n't nearly enough*****0
one dollar above the minimum wage is n't enough to make paying for groceries , rent and transportation much easier , especially coming from a company that makes nearly $ 5 billion a year in profits*****1
it 's not enough for clothing or health care*****0
it 's not enough , as people of my faith say , for those cooks and cashiers to afford their daily bread*****0
thirdly , the raise does nothing to help workers have a voice in determining their workplace conditions*****1
@entity33 's and other companies need to stop trying to prevent their workers from speaking out together in a union*****1
they should respect workers ' right to collectively demand sensible schedules and such basics as adequate first aid kits , and not being compelled to work off the clock*****0
we are at a turning point in @entity45 history*****0
we are at a @entity94*****0
we are at the moment when forces come together to push this country forward toward the goal of a better life for all : sustainable wages , affordable health care , quality education , and , respect for workers ' right to stick together in unions so they can be heard*****0
we are wining this fight , and the @entity16 's announcement is proof that the momentum is on our side*****1
when all @entity33 's workers have more money in their pockets , they will inject money back into their neighborhoods , boosting the entire economy*****1
instead of houses in foreclosure and hungry children , we would have a rising wage floor and thriving communities that support more jobs*****0
today , thousands of @entity33 's workers live below the federal poverty line*****1
many get help from government programs , especially food stamps , to make it week to week*****0
whether we like it or not , our tax dollars help @entity33 's keep wages artificially low*****0
this is n't just an economic issue*****0
it 's a moral issue*****0
i 've talked to workers at @entity33 's restaurants who say they have to skip meals because they do n't have enough money*****1
the rev. @entity141 once said , " what good is having the right to sit at a lunch counter if you ca n't afford to buy a hamburger ? " it 's time for @entity33 's to make sure all the people who serve its burgers are paid enough to afford to eat them for dinner*****0
but we are n't going to wait for divine intervention*****0
we 're going to keep organizing and keep fighting until the workers at @entity16 , and every other fast - food restaurant , get what makes sense for their families and our communities : a $ 15 per hour wage and a path to form a union without interference or retaliation*****1
@entity33 's took a small step forward by raising wages for a small minority of the people who run their stores*****1
it 's time for the corporation to find a way to raise wages for everyone working in its restaurants so they can pay their bills , put some money back into their community , and expand prosperity and opportunity across our land .*****1
