( @entity0 ) it was a masterful performance . i watched in awe on thursday as cardiothoracic surgeon and celebrity talk show host @entity4 surfed a gargantuan wave of criticism to shore . i should have expected that dr. @entity4 would keep standing in the face of charges from a group of colleagues that he pushed " quack treatments ... for personal financial gain . " and thanks to the ineptitude of his critics this round , he may have actually boosted his media empire . but he 's increasingly serving himself at a cost to @entity24 and @entity25 . if dr. @entity4 was ever going to go down , surely his ship would 've sunk last summer in the wake of his disastrous testimony before a @entity30 subcommittee . he was ostensibly invited to speak as an expert witness about bogus weight loss products , but sen. @entity33 , chairwoman of the @entity30 's @entity34 , instead made him her chief example of the kind of snake oil salesmen that keep hoodwinking consumers into thinking there 's a quick fix for their expanding waistlines . @entity43 subsequently eviscerated @entity4 on his hit @entity45 show " @entity46 . " in a segment that 's now garnered over 6 million @entity49 views , @entity43 makes quick work of @entity4 's claims about " magic " green coffee beans , a product that 's now earned a $ 9 million @entity55 fine for its false marketing claims . despite his utter humiliation , dr. @entity4 soldiered on , with his university and hospital continuing to stand by him , and with @entity61 and @entity62 , who co-produce " the dr. @entity64 , " fully behind his program . if the @entity30 could n't bring him down , what made this particular collection of 10 doctors think they could do it with their recent letter to @entity24 , where dr. @entity4 holds a tenured professorship and administrative position in the @entity74 and performs his duties at @entity24 - affiliated @entity25 ? the doctors insisted that the university must disassociate itself from dr. @entity4 for his now well - established tendency to promote cure - alls more befitting 1915 than 2015 . turnabout is fair play . and @entity4 and his producers responded with alacrity , slicing and dicing his ill - prepared challengers with an investigative segment that would 've made " @entity86 " proud . he and his team score points with me for pointing out the media 's own failings in delightedly circulating the letter without looking into the backgrounds of anyone involved . it 's a simple matter to question ulterior motives when the letter itself takes pains to highlight @entity4 's critical attitude toward gmo foods , not one of his greatest indiscretions by a long shot . dr. @entity4 after all has conducted experiments on his tv audience , apparently in violation of the rules of his own academic medical center . he has a propensity to spout laughably definitive statements with little to no scientific support , such as his advice that " every kid in @entity115 ought to be on @entity117 fatty acids and @entity118 from either the sun or a pill " because this regimen will help them withstand concussions . instead of mounting a defense of the indefensible claims he delivers so easily and often , dr. @entity4 routed his critics by quickly pivoting to the undercurrents of their letter . he correctly pointed out that several of the letter 's signatories are @entity133 industry shills . one of the writers campaigned against a @entity136 proposition requiring @entity133 labeling , and one of the bunch even served time for felony medicaid fraud . these characters never stood a chance in tipping the scales against dr. @entity4 , but they got their headlines nonetheless . dr. @entity4 was able to transition their critique of his apparent disregard for science on his program into an easily vanquished attack on his straightforward stand for consumers ' right to accurate product labeling . when my wife first brought the letter to my attention , i immediately wanted to know whether these were @entity24 physicians . this whole affair would 've played out quite differently if a slate of credible colleagues based at his own institution were coming out against dr. oz. so far they 've made no demand for his resignation , though some colleagues made their discomfort public in an op - ed for @entity169 last week . dr. @entity4 is well - aware that some colleagues question him , discussing that tension in his @entity172 op - ed. he says he does n't expect all physicians to understand his approach to health promotion , where he 's willing to entertain just about everything , even seances . the closed , physician - only social network @entity179 issued dr. @entity4 numerous questions from its membership , none of which dr. @entity4 answered . they are revelatory of physician attitudes toward him nonetheless . one doc asked dr. @entity4 how he could keep up with the fast - changing world of cardiothoracic surgery and carry on with his show every weekday . another asked him how he knows so much about so many areas of medicine -- " @entity193 certified n all these areas ? " . both types of questions show the profound disconnect between most physicians , who tend not to speak unless they are certain in their expertise on a topic , and the way the media industry works . dr. @entity4 's show does n't require he stay up late at night prepping for the next day -- he has an office full of production staff behind him . let 's take it as a given that not every physician across @entity115 , or at @entity24 , has to agree with what dr. @entity4 says on his program . i certainly do n't . does he have the right to say it ? yes , but not without challenge . a real case can be made that dr. @entity4 has used his media megaphone to do harm as well as good . he is now a polarizing figure , and while @entity24 should be lauded for protecting the free speech of its academic staff , the equation with dr. @entity4 is becoming increasingly complex . he 's no longer simply good pr for the @entity24 and @entity25 , which is often featured in his show . the letter writers were correct about one thing : @entity24 's reputation is now linked with the @entity226 standing right out in front .

" and thanks to the ineptitude of his critics this round , he may have actually boosted his media empire*****0
but he 's increasingly serving himself at a cost to @entity24 and @entity25*****0
if dr. @entity4 was ever going to go down , surely his ship would 've sunk last summer in the wake of his disastrous testimony before a @entity30 subcommittee*****1
he was ostensibly invited to speak as an expert witness about bogus weight loss products , but sen. @entity33 , chairwoman of the @entity30 's @entity34 , instead made him her chief example of the kind of snake oil salesmen that keep hoodwinking consumers into thinking there 's a quick fix for their expanding waistlines*****0

turnabout is fair play*****0
and @entity4 and his producers responded with alacrity , slicing and dicing his ill - prepared challengers with an investigative segment that would 've made " @entity86 " proud*****0
he and his team score points with me for pointing out the media 's own failings in delightedly circulating the letter without looking into the backgrounds of anyone involved*****0
it 's a simple matter to question ulterior motives when the letter itself takes pains to highlight @entity4 's critical attitude toward gmo foods , not one of his greatest indiscretions by a long shot*****0
dr. @entity4 after all has conducted experiments on his tv audience , apparently in violation of the rules of his own academic medical center*****1

dr. @entity4 's show does n't require he stay up late at night prepping for the next day -- he has an office full of production staff behind him*****0
let 's take it as a given that not every physician across @entity115 , or at @entity24 , has to agree with what dr. @entity4 says on his program*****0
i certainly do n't*****0
does he have the right to say it ? yes , but not without challenge*****0
