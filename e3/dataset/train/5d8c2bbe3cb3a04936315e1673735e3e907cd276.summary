( @entity0 ) are we alone in the cosmos ? or might there be intelligent life elsewhere ? last week , @entity6 scientists discussed in very concrete terms the steps to discovering life elsewhere in the universe over the next decade or two*****1
this year is the 20th anniversary of the discovery of a planet around a star like our own sun , @entity17*****0
since then , ground - based surveys and @entity6 's @entity20 satellite have discovered nearly 2,000 confirmed " exoplanets , " and thousands more candidates await confirmation*****0
many of these planetary systems are quite unlike our own solar system*****0
some have large planets like @entity30 that orbit their stars far closer than @entity32 , the innermost planet in our solar system*****0
but smaller rocky planets like @entity37 , though harder to find , appear to be even more abundant*****0
life on @entity37 developed in its oceans about a billion years after the planet formed*****0
that suggests that rocky planets with liquid water on their surfaces might also have developed primitive forms of life*****0
life as we know it is carbon - based and requires liquid water*****0
astronomers define the " habitable zone " around a star as the region within which liquid water can exist on a planet 's surface*****0
any closer to the star , the water will boil into vapor ; any farther and the water freezes into ice*****0
extrapolating from discoveries to date , astronomers estimate there are perhaps 40 billion @entity37 - like , habitable - zone planets in our @entity65 galaxy alone*****1
of course , there is a difference between single - celled organisms -- which developed 3.8 billion years ago and remained the most sophisticated form of life for another billion years or so -- and mammals , which appeared about 200 million years ago*****0
and then the humans , who have existed for only 200,000 years*****0
intelligent life that can communicate via radio waves with other intelligent life is less than 100 years old here on @entity37*****1
so while planets that develop simple forms of life may be a dime a dozen , the number that have sentient beings with whom to converse -- even assuming they evolved as humans did , with ears and spoken language , or eyes and written language -- is likely to be tiny*****0
and life that can use radio waves has existed on @entity37 for only 0.000002 % of the planet 's history -- 100 years out of 4.5 billion*****0
if the half dozen or so rocky , @entity37 - like exoplanets now known are similar , the odds of discovering humanlike life on them are about the same as , well , winning your state lottery with one ticket*****0
of course , if there are 40 billion @entity37 - like planets out there , the odds improve quite a bit*****0
if they all have histories like the @entity37 's , there might be 1,000 planets in the @entity65 that could support communicative beings*****0
but before you start composing your first letter to an alien , think about this : the chance that those beings evolved on exactly the same time scale is minuscule*****0
another planet 's 100 years of brilliance might have occurred a billion years ago , or it might happen a billion years in the future*****0
a lot depends on how long communication capabilities last*****0
civilizations that can build huge telescopes and broadcast stations also have the technology to destroy their planet*****0
so the duration of the @entity129 on a planet could be short*****0
not to mention : the average light - travel - time to such a planet could be tens of thousands of years , so unless humans evolve to be ageless , we 're not exchanging ims with aliens anytime soon*****0
if advanced civilizations can maintain their capabilities for millions of years or more , the chances of communicating with them are not negligible*****0
but in that case , they are likely to be far more sophisticated than we are ( since they developed the capability far earlier than we did ) -- so if they wanted us to know they exist , would n't they simply tell us ? the @entity150 project has been listening for such broadcasts for more than 30 years in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence*****0
probably the most likely form of life on exoplanets is far more primitive*****0
astronomers have found signatures of organic molecules , the building blocks of life , in the interstellar material that permeates the space between stars in our galaxy*****1
possible signatures of living organisms on distant exoplanets include an oxygen - rich atmosphere , such as that created by the first bacteria on @entity37 , or perhaps methane or carbon dioxide*****0
@entity6 's @entity176 , to be launched in 2018 , will look for evidence of life in the atmospheres of rocky , habitable exoplanets*****1
@entity6 's rovers have shown that @entity182 was once much more habitable*****0
it had fresh - water lakes and streams of water running along its surface*****0
some water still remains , and there may yet be life discovered on @entity182*****0
new missions plan to look at @entity193 and @entity194 , moons of @entity30 that have liquid water below their icy surfaces*****0
life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own @entity65 galaxy , is practically inevitable*****1
signs of life on exoplanets orbiting nearby stars will probably be discovered in the coming decades with advanced telescopes*****1
but the chance of talking to those little green men will probably have to wait for another few hundred million years .*****0
