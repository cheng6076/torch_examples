( @entity1 ) the @entity0 has gained much from its position as a space - faring nation*****1
indeed , @entity0 access to space has provided incredible benefit to @entity0 national security , defense and the economic well - being of the nation*****1
and in order to effectively confront current and future conflicts , combat terrorism and counter the proliferating threats worldwide , our military depends on space - based capabilities , including intelligence , gps , and communications satellites*****0
unfortunately , as global threats increase and the need for assured space access accelerates , the @entity0 is faced with a troubling reality -- we are far too reliant on @entity26 technology to meet our national security obligations*****1
how ? for a start , we depend on the @entity30 rocket , which carries many of our most important satellites and is powered by the @entity26 - made @entity33 rocket engine*****0
the fact that we rely on @entity26 , currently under sanctions for invading a sovereign nation , should reinforce the need for a change in our current course*****0
assured access to space is an area where the @entity0 should not be reliant on nonsecure foreign supply chains , which are subject to disruption , threats , unfavorable contracts and undue leverage against the interests of the @entity0 the @entity50 crisis should have served as a wake - up call , highlighting the danger of dependence on @entity26 to launch national security satellites into space*****1
and the @entity0 should play no part in supporting the defense industry of a country that continues to abrogate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbors*****0
simply put , it is bad policy to rely on others for critical national security requirements , and worse policy when this reliance supports countries taking action in direct contradiction to @entity0 national security interests*****1
@entity73 , a @entity26 deputy prime minister in charge of defense and space industries , has called @entity0 taxpayer outlays for the @entity26 engine " free money " that goes directly back into @entity26 's missile modernization programs*****1
it is high time the @entity0 government turn to its existing domestic capability and turn off this flow of funds*****0
fortunately , there are some signs of progress*****0
last year , @entity91 took bipartisan action to phase out reliance on the @entity94 by the end of the decade , and to transition to an all - american space launch capability*****0
the defense authorization for fiscal year 2015 included restrictions on the future use of the @entity33 for the @entity30 , authorizing $ 220 million to begin development of a @entity0 alternative*****0
this was a wise move , but it 's not enough*****0
there are steps that the @entity0 can take now to ensure our access to space and secure our comparative advantage in space -- and in the world*****1
true , development of a new launch system will take time ; there are no overnight answers*****0
however , a combination of existing capabilities and dynamic development of new capabilities by the private sector can serve as a foundation for eliminating any capability gap in the @entity0 space program*****1
indeed , new entrants are coming online using launch vehicle systems fully designed and manufactured in @entity0*****0
the two main launch competitors -- @entity130 and @entity131 -- each have all - american systems , namely @entity130 's @entity135 family of rockets and @entity131 's @entity137*****0
having both options will put @entity0 on the path to fielding its indigenous space capabilities for the next generation , while strengthening a space industrial base weakened since the end of the @entity144*****1
the short - term goal should be to transition to existing @entity0 - manufactured launch vehicles , as opposed to phasing out systems such as the @entity135 , which continue to provide critical capability*****0
in the long term , next - generation development programs should not involve major @entity26 subsystems and components*****0
it is time to end @entity0 's reliance on @entity26 's rocket engine*****0
this would be good for national security , good for @entity0 innovation and the industrial base -- and good for our country 's future .*****1
