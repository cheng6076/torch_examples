( @entity1 ) @entity0 is all in*****0
the @entity3 senator from @entity4 has announced that he is seeking the @entity3 presidential nomination , running on an optimistic message that he embodies the promise of the @entity8*****0
with his youthful energy and @entity12 roots , it 's tempting to see @entity0 as the new blood that the @entity3 needs in order to compete against @entity15 in 2016*****1
yet @entity0 has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues : immigration reform and @entity20 relations*****1
he holds little appeal to @entity12 voters*****0
and unless he can offer new ideas , his climb to the @entity3 nomination will be steep*****0
back in 2013 , @entity0 was a member of the @entity26 " that crafted a bipartisan proposal for comprehensive reform , including a path to citizenship for the nation 's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants*****1
he later distanced himself from the bill after it ran into resistance from @entity36 , and now says he favors a piecemeal approach , starting with securing the border*****0
his retreat on immigration means that @entity0 has missed an opportunity to set himself apart from most of the presumptive @entity3 presidential candidates*****1
that 's a shame , for this issue was supposed to be his calling card to @entity12 voters*****0
instead , @entity0 has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration*****1
he believes that president @entity49 's @entity48 program , offering deportation relief to young immigrants , should be ended*****0
he has stated that the president 's executive action on immigration , on hold pending a circuit court review , sets a " horrifying precedent*****0
" meanwhile , both the @entity48 program and president @entity49 's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by @entity12*****1
no wonder the research firm @entity59 reports that , " we find no evidence that @entity0 's candidacy will draw significant @entity12 support for his candidacy or for his party more generally*****1
" so , if @entity0 is counting on his ethnicity and personal history as the son of immigrants to win over fellow @entity12 , he is mistaken*****1
at a private breakfast monday for supporters , @entity0 described running against " one candidate in the race who 's from yesterday , and one who wants to take us back to yesterday*****0
" but when it comes to @entity20 policy , @entity0 himself seems firmly stuck in the past*****1
over the weekend , he called the recent thaw in relations between the two countries ridiculous*****0
he has warned that @entity20 is taking advantage of the @entity85*****0
here , he is an increasingly lonely voice*****0
most @entity85 support better relations with @entity20 , as do a majority of @entity89*****1
by clinging to the notion that isolating @entity20 is better than engaging with the communist country , @entity0 has marginalized himself on an issue where he could have provided insight and leadership*****1
immigration and @entity20 policy aside , @entity0 's political philosophy will be a tough sell to @entity12*****1
he is a fierce opponent of " @entity99 " and wants the law repealed*****0
however , the @entity99 has led to a 12.3 % drop in the @entity12 uninsured rate , making @entity104 the demographic with the largest gain in insurance , thanks to the law*****1
( in fact , @entity0 signed his own family up for " @entity99 " on the @entity112 exchange , taking advantage of a generous federal subsidy offered to lawmakers*****0
) @entity0 favors smaller government , while @entity104 are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less*****1
and though @entity0 doubts that climate change is caused by humans , the @entity121 has noted that @entity104 view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue*****1
sure , @entity0 is young and charismatic*****0
but his work on the failed immigration bill notwithstanding , @entity0 has a significant lack of accomplishments to show for his five years in the senate*****1
in february , he was reported as topping the list of absentee lawmakers by the website @entity136*****0
another @entity0 weakness is his lack of bold policy proposals*****0
consider that his fellow contender for the @entity3 presidential nomination , sen. @entity142 of @entity143 , has been willing to present new ideas to the @entity3 base , such as reforming the criminal justice system and legalizing medical marijuana*****0
or that another @entity3 candidate for president , sen. @entity148 of @entity149 is entirely comfortable with his image as a conservative firebrand*****0
by comparison , @entity0 seems cautious and ill - suited to the task of rousing @entity3 voters*****0
with his early leap into the 2016 race , @entity0 is positioning himself as the next generation of @entity3 leadership*****0
unfortunately , a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination -- not for @entity0 , and not for @entity12 voters .*****1
