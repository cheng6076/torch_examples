( @entity2 ) for lt. colonel @entity1 , the scenery is all too familiar . this is his sixth tour in @entity4 , and he 's back doing a job that he 's been tasked with before : training @entity4 soldiers . @entity1 and other active @entity8 military personnel are on the ground in @entity4 , whipping often ill - equipped government troops into shape . they 've been here before , but this time , he feels , they 're getting it right . but the @entity8 military is n't the only contingent of @entity18 forces in the region -- dozens of foreigners , including @entity8 , have volunteered to take the fight to @entity22 . and increasingly , @entity8 military training efforts are being supplemented by outside agencies , who are working with @entity27 government troops and even militia in @entity4 and @entity29 .

" the information i 've been getting back is that there 's very little use for ( @entity18 fighters ) on the front lines , especially on the @entity81 side -- they have significant numbers of personnel -- it 's a source of @entity27 pride for them to rise up in scenarios like this . they more need the development assistance . " @entity33 spokesman @entity99 also told @entity27 news wire @entity100 that it was illegal for foreigners to join their ranks . while individual fighters are not always accepted , volunteers working as military trainers are sharing their expertise to support those on the front lines of the fight against @entity22 forces . @entity30 set up 1st @entity112 ( 1st @entity112 ) , a training body which , he says , is currently providing material support and training to the @entity33 , whose name means " those who face death , " in northern @entity4 . " internal capacity building is by far the solution that you can put into a region that is suffering instability from conflict , " he told @entity2 by phone from his base in @entity121 , @entity31 . " increasing their ability to maintain stability over the long term is far better than trying to influx it with a bunch of westerners who are going to leave within a short period of time .

" we 're confident the @entity8 military mission of degrading and ultimately defeating ( @entity22 ) will be found by working through our @entity152 partners and the international community , " maj. @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , told @entity2 . " the training element of the mission is no different . it relies on direct and comprehensive military cooperation with regional partner nations , who share a mutual interest in promoting security . one of the goals of the train and equip program , is to build the capabilities of the moderate @entity29 fighters to defend the @entity29 people . we are confident in our efforts . " with coalition members keen to distance themselves from calls for @entity18 boots on the ground -- and little political appetite from overseas for risking @entity18 troops in what many see as a sectarian conflict , @entity30 contends that the best - case scenario is exactly the kind of logistical support that organizations like 1st @entity112 are providing . @entity22 is keen to play up religious and sectarian divisions in order to create the perception that they are the @entity185 protectors of a persecuted underclass , sending @entity188 troops into the battlefield -- even in a support role -- could play into that divisive rhetoric . @entity30 downplays this risk , saying the threat is there , and is best contained in the region . providing noncombat backing , such as medical , weaponry , logistical and training assistance would appear , he thinks , to be the best way of supporting those @entity27 and @entity201 troops on the front . " regardless of perceptions of any kind of us - against - them scenario , it absolutely is a world - against - @entity22 issue that needs to take place and there definitely needs to be a global response , " he said .
