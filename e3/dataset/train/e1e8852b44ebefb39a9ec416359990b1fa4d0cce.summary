( @entity4 ) in a tragic echo of the catastrophic events in @entity3 in 2010 , a powerful earthquake struck one of the poorest nations on @entity7 today*****1
the latest estimates from seismologists put the magnitude at 7.9 , which would actually makes it about 40 % larger than the 7.8 currently being reported*****1
that 's less than half the size of the previous major event nearby in 1934 , which killed around 10,000 people*****0
unfortunately , it is quite possible the number of dead in @entity19 could rise to match it*****0
we knew this disaster was coming eventually*****1
geophysicists have long monitored how fast the @entity7 's plates are moving , and we know that the entire subcontinent of @entity26 is being driven slowly but surely underneath @entity27 and @entity28 at a speed of around 1.8 inches per year*****0
it 's the reason @entity31 exists*****0
latest updates on @entity27 earthquake over millions of years , the squeezing has crushed the @entity35 like a concertina , raising mountains to heights of several miles and triggering earthquakes on a regular basis from @entity41 to @entity42*****1
saturday 's quake was neither unusual nor unexpected , although it was larger than most*****0
in the 81 years since the 1934 @entity47 earthquake , the land mass of @entity26 has been pushed about 12 feet into @entity27*****1
think of all that movement getting stored in a giant spring lying under @entity27*****0
the spring is stuck on a broad , rough surface which we call a fault plane ( a fault line is what we see when it emerges from the ground )*****0
fallen : @entity27 's historic landmarks sometimes , energy stored in the spring gets big enough to slip catastrophically , releasing all that pent - up strain and generating shaking strong enough to destroy buildings and kill people over a huge area*****1
the bigger the area that slips , and the larger the pent - up energy , the greater the damage*****0
saturday 's slip took place over an area about 1,000 to 2,000 square miles over a zone spanning the cities of @entity19 and @entity72 in one direction , and almost the entire @entity35 mountain width in the other*****0
a part of @entity26 slid about one to 10 feet northwards and underneath @entity27 in a matter of seconds*****0
we have this kind of detailed data thanks to major advances in seismology over recent years*****0
using measurements of shaking recorded on seismometers scattered across the world and sent in near or real time to agencies like the @entity88 and to universities such as @entity90 , we can infer the location and magnitude of a big earthquake very quickly*****1
avalanches hamper @entity31 rescue efforts not just that : we can now estimate the pattern and speed of rapid sliding across its fault surface*****0
what used to take months of careful academic study now takes minutes of computation*****0
in @entity3 in 2010 , although the earthquake was more than 20 times weaker than saturday 's , well over 100,000 people are thought to have been killed around @entity105 by the shaking and its after - effects*****1
yet despite some differences , the @entity27 and @entity3 earthquakes also share similarities -- both geological events were known to be approaching , and both struck areas afflicted by widespread poverty , rapid increases in population in urban areas , uncoordinated changes in building infrastructure and lack of adherence to improved building codes*****1
about 1.45 million people live in @entity19 , the majority in poorly constructed homes not designed to withstand the kind of shaking seen on saturday*****0
@entity27 has a per capita income of around $ 1,350 , only a notch above that of @entity3 , and among the lowest in the world*****0
meeting building codes in new construction , or taking on expensive retrofitting , is way beyond the means of most*****0
to make matters worse , the valley itself appears to focus the destructive shaking of earthquake waves*****0
studies have long predicted that the @entity19 area was due a magnitude - 8 earthquake , or higher -- one study predicted between 21,000 and 42,000 fatalities if a magnitude - 8.1 earthquake had struck the area*****1
( fortunately , saturday 's shaking was half that intensity )*****0
still , this catastrophe comes at a delicate time for @entity27 as it emerges from a long - running civil war and its economy has been improving steadily*****1
we have to hope that recovery from both can somehow take place despite the enormous challenges ahead .*****0
