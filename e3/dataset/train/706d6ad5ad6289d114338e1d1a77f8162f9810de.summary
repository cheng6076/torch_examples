( @entity1 ) it took prosecutors months to present 131 witnesses to support their claim that former @entity6 star @entity5 killed semi-pro player @entity7 . on monday , @entity5 's defense gave its side of the story , wrapping up its witnesses in less than a day . @entity5 , 25 , is on trial for the shooting death of @entity7 , whose body was found in a @entity16 industrial park in june 2013 . now that the defense has rested , it wo n't be long before the jury begins deliberating . much of the evidence in the former @entity22 ' case is circumstantial . here are some key points jurors will have to consider after each side makes closing arguments on tuesday : as news spread that @entity5 was under investigation in june 2013 , @entity22 owner @entity26 called in the tight end for a meeting two days after @entity7 's death . " he said he was not involved , " @entity26 testified last week . " he said he was innocent , and that he hoped that the time of the murder incident came out because he said he was in a club . " there 's only one potential problem with that claim : the time @entity7 was killed had n't been made public yet by the time @entity5 met with @entity38 . so how could @entity5 have known when @entity7 was killed ? " what a great , great witness for the prosecution , " @entity1 legal analyst @entity39 said . " basically what happened is @entity5 lied to his boss . and the only way you rebut it is if you put him on the stand . " when questioned by a defense attorney , @entity38 said that he 'd never had any problems with @entity5 and that the player was always respectful to him . @entity5 's fiancee , @entity51 , revealed for the first time last week that @entity5 told her to dispose of a box from the couple 's home that she said reeked of marijuana . she also said she did n't know what was in the box . that revelation may contradict the prosecution 's contention that the weapon used in the killing was in the box . the murder weapon in the case has not been recovered . during cross-examination by the defense , @entity51 testified that she suspected marijuana because the box smelled " skunky . " earlier , she told prosecutors during direct examination that she did n't know what was in the box . she said @entity5 never told her , and she never looked . after concealing the box with her daughter 's clothing , @entity51 said she threw it away in " a random dumpster " but could not remember exactly where . much testimony has focused on the shoes @entity5 wore the night @entity7 was shot . a @entity84 consultant testified that @entity5 was wearing @entity86 @entity85 . about 93,000 pairs of that shoe were made , significantly fewer in a size 13 . the shoe 's sole makes a distinct impression , said lt. @entity93 of the @entity94 . the consultant testified under questioning from defense attorney @entity96 that other @entity84 shoes -- more than 3 million -- make the same impression . yet @entity93 , who works in crime scene services , testified that the footprint left near @entity7 's body was " in agreement " or consistent with the @entity103 @entity85 size 13 . although he did not have the shoes that @entity5 wore that night , he used an identical pair to make his determination . @entity93 did so by creating a transparency of the sole and laying it over a photo of the footwear impression . jurors watched as he drew lines showing how the sole aligned with the impression . what may have been a key moment for the prosecution was quickly derailed by defense attorney @entity96 . @entity96 questioned the science behind analyzing footprints . he introduced a march 2014 investigative report written by @entity93 saying the partial footwear impression lacked certain detail and quality to be able to make a comparison . prosecutors used grainy footage from @entity5 's home security system to suggest he was holding a .45 - caliber handgun -- the same kind of gun police said was used to kill @entity7 . @entity5 could be seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after @entity7 was shot to death in an industrial park about a mile from @entity5 's home . " in my opinion , the firearm shown in the video stills is a glock pistol , " @entity134 sales manager @entity133 testified . the video is time - stamped minutes after workers in a nearby industrial park describe hearing loud noises like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say @entity7 was gunned down after getting out of a car @entity5 was driving . @entity5 's lawyers then showed a different part of the video time - stamped a few seconds earlier with @entity5 holding what appeared to be a shiny object in one hand , suggesting it may be an @entity153 .

" no , they do not , " @entity133 answered . @entity96 then displayed a soft - pellet gun similar in shape to a @entity134 , suggesting it could also be the object @entity5 is holding . @entity5 has pleaded not guilty in @entity7 's death . but already , his arrest has led to deep consequences , including his release from the @entity22 and the loss of millions of dollars in expected earnings . so what might make a young man who had signed a $ 40 million contract risk everything ? prosecutors have said @entity7 might have done or said something that did n't sit well with @entity5 . they claimed @entity5 rounded up some friends and orchestrated a hit to settle the score . @entity5 's co-defendants , @entity178 and @entity179 , also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately . but the case gets more complicated . evidence collected in @entity7 's death investigation led to two more murder charges against @entity5 in a separate case in @entity185 . @entity5 is also accused of shooting @entity186 and @entity187 , allegedly over a spilled drink at a nightclub . that double shooting took place in july 2012 , almost a year before @entity7 was killed . prosecutors have said in pretrial hearings that @entity5 may have been mad at himself for possibly showing @entity7 the spot where that double murder happened . during trial , prosecutors suggest a text written by @entity5 the day before the murder saying he was " buggin " for showing @entity7 " the spot " may have played a role in plotting to kill @entity7 . the judge has banned any mention of the double murder in @entity7 's trial , ruling it is prejudicial . @entity5 has pleaded not guilty in those deaths as well . but when the @entity7 trial ends , that murder trial awaits him . @entity1 's @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 and @entity212 contributed to this report .

( @entity1 ) it took prosecutors months to present 131 witnesses to support their claim that former @entity6 star @entity5 killed semi-pro player @entity7*****1
on monday , @entity5 's defense gave its side of the story , wrapping up its witnesses in less than a day*****1
@entity5 , 25 , is on trial for the shooting death of @entity7 , whose body was found in a @entity16 industrial park in june 2013*****1
now that the defense has rested , it wo n't be long before the jury begins deliberating*****0
much of the evidence in the former @entity22 ' case is circumstantial*****0
here are some key points jurors will have to consider after each side makes closing arguments on tuesday : as news spread that @entity5 was under investigation in june 2013 , @entity22 owner @entity26 called in the tight end for a meeting two days after @entity7 's death*****1
" he said he was not involved , " @entity26 testified last week*****0
" he said he was innocent , and that he hoped that the time of the murder incident came out because he said he was in a club*****0
" there 's only one potential problem with that claim : the time @entity7 was killed had n't been made public yet by the time @entity5 met with @entity38*****1
so how could @entity5 have known when @entity7 was killed ? " what a great , great witness for the prosecution , " @entity1 legal analyst @entity39 said*****1
" basically what happened is @entity5 lied to his boss*****0
and the only way you rebut it is if you put him on the stand*****0
" when questioned by a defense attorney , @entity38 said that he 'd never had any problems with @entity5 and that the player was always respectful to him*****1
@entity5 's fiancee , @entity51 , revealed for the first time last week that @entity5 told her to dispose of a box from the couple 's home that she said reeked of marijuana*****0
she also said she did n't know what was in the box*****0
that revelation may contradict the prosecution 's contention that the weapon used in the killing was in the box*****0
the murder weapon in the case has not been recovered*****1
during cross-examination by the defense , @entity51 testified that she suspected marijuana because the box smelled " skunky*****0
" earlier , she told prosecutors during direct examination that she did n't know what was in the box*****0
she said @entity5 never told her , and she never looked*****0
after concealing the box with her daughter 's clothing , @entity51 said she threw it away in " a random dumpster " but could not remember exactly where*****0
much testimony has focused on the shoes @entity5 wore the night @entity7 was shot*****1
a @entity84 consultant testified that @entity5 was wearing @entity86 @entity85*****0
about 93,000 pairs of that shoe were made , significantly fewer in a size 13*****0
the shoe 's sole makes a distinct impression , said lt. @entity93 of the @entity94*****0
the consultant testified under questioning from defense attorney @entity96 that other @entity84 shoes -- more than 3 million -- make the same impression*****0
yet @entity93 , who works in crime scene services , testified that the footprint left near @entity7 's body was " in agreement " or consistent with the @entity103 @entity85 size 13*****0
although he did not have the shoes that @entity5 wore that night , he used an identical pair to make his determination*****0
@entity93 did so by creating a transparency of the sole and laying it over a photo of the footwear impression*****0
jurors watched as he drew lines showing how the sole aligned with the impression*****0
what may have been a key moment for the prosecution was quickly derailed by defense attorney @entity96*****0
@entity96 questioned the science behind analyzing footprints*****0
he introduced a march 2014 investigative report written by @entity93 saying the partial footwear impression lacked certain detail and quality to be able to make a comparison*****0
prosecutors used grainy footage from @entity5 's home security system to suggest he was holding a .45 - caliber handgun -- the same kind of gun police said was used to kill @entity7*****1
@entity5 could be seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after @entity7 was shot to death in an industrial park about a mile from @entity5 's home*****1
" in my opinion , the firearm shown in the video stills is a glock pistol , " @entity134 sales manager @entity133 testified*****0
the video is time - stamped minutes after workers in a nearby industrial park describe hearing loud noises like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say @entity7 was gunned down after getting out of a car @entity5 was driving*****1
@entity5 's lawyers then showed a different part of the video time - stamped a few seconds earlier with @entity5 holding what appeared to be a shiny object in one hand , suggesting it may be an @entity153*****1
" glock pistols do n't have white glows to them , do they ? " defense attorney @entity154 asked*****0
" no , they do not , " @entity133 answered*****0
@entity96 then displayed a soft - pellet gun similar in shape to a @entity134 , suggesting it could also be the object @entity5 is holding*****1
@entity5 has pleaded not guilty in @entity7 's death*****1
but already , his arrest has led to deep consequences , including his release from the @entity22 and the loss of millions of dollars in expected earnings*****0
so what might make a young man who had signed a $ 40 million contract risk everything ? prosecutors have said @entity7 might have done or said something that did n't sit well with @entity5*****1
they claimed @entity5 rounded up some friends and orchestrated a hit to settle the score*****0
@entity5 's co-defendants , @entity178 and @entity179 , also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately*****0
but the case gets more complicated*****0
evidence collected in @entity7 's death investigation led to two more murder charges against @entity5 in a separate case in @entity185*****1
@entity5 is also accused of shooting @entity186 and @entity187 , allegedly over a spilled drink at a nightclub*****0
that double shooting took place in july 2012 , almost a year before @entity7 was killed*****0
prosecutors have said in pretrial hearings that @entity5 may have been mad at himself for possibly showing @entity7 the spot where that double murder happened*****1
during trial , prosecutors suggest a text written by @entity5 the day before the murder saying he was " buggin " for showing @entity7 " the spot " may have played a role in plotting to kill @entity7*****1
the judge has banned any mention of the double murder in @entity7 's trial , ruling it is prejudicial*****1
@entity5 has pleaded not guilty in those deaths as well*****0
but when the @entity7 trial ends , that murder trial awaits him*****1
