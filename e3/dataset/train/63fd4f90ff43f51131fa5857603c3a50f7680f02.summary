( @entity0 ) late one night on @entity1 , a girl with cystic fibrosis messaged a boy with cystic fibrosis , and both their lives were changed forever . the girl , @entity7 , read that the boy , @entity8 , was very sick . " if you ever need a friend to talk to , you can reach out to me , " she wrote . " sorry , but do i know you ? " he responded . no , you do n't , @entity7 wrote back , and told @entity8 a bit about herself . like him , she was 18 , and " my breathing is pretty crappy and i see you are in the hospital . i 'm sorry . i know it sucks ! ... but you just got ta stay strong . " messages between the two flew back and forth . they realized they were falling in love . for most other couples , the next step would be to meet in person . but for @entity7 and @entity8 , that was complicated -- and dangerous . cystic fibrosis patients should n't be near each other because they can share infections that could cripple their already fragile lungs . dr. @entity31 at the @entity32 , @entity7 's pulmonologist since she was a little girl , had lectured her many times that face - to - face meetings with other @entity37 patients were a bad idea . in their online conversations , one of the first things @entity8 told @entity7 about himself was that he had @entity42 , a horribly dangerous infection for people with @entity37 " i was like , ' hi , i 'm @entity8 from @entity44 and i have @entity42 , ' because it 's such a big deal in the @entity37 community , " he remembers . " i left the decision about whether we should meet up completely up to her . " @entity7 listened to her heart , even if it might hurt her lungs . she asked @entity8 to come visit her in @entity53 , @entity54 . " i told @entity8 i 'd rather be happy -- like really , really happy -- for five years of my life and die sooner than be mediocre happy and live for twenty years , " @entity7 says . " that was definitely something i had to think about , but when you have those feelings , you just know . " so on august 28 , 2009 , @entity8 drove more than six hours from @entity60 , @entity44 , to @entity7 's hometown in @entity53 , @entity54 , where they 'd arranged to meet at the @entity63 . at 7:10 pm -- they remember the time precisely -- @entity7 got out of her car and saw @entity8 leaning against a brick wall looking cool and handsome in his sunglasses . " my heart was racing , but i just went right up to him and hugged and kissed him on the mouth without even saying hello , " she remembers . " i 'm usually not that kind of girl , but it just felt so right . " @entity7 took @entity8 and his mother , @entity73 , who 'd made the trip with him , to have dinner with her and her parents , @entity77 and @entity78 . later the young couple drove around @entity53 , and @entity8 gave her a necklace for her nineteenth birthday , which was two days before . their health quickly deteriorated , and within months , the new husband and wife went on oxygen full time . too ill to work , @entity8 quit his job at his family 's auto repair shop , and @entity7 quit hers as a store clerk . in august , 2014 , the couple entered the @entity93 together to wait for new lungs . @entity8 's came first , and on november 17 , he had his transplant . despite his @entity42 , which makes transplants more complicated , it was a success . " i was so thrilled . i was so happy for him , " @entity7 says . the month after @entity8 's surgery , @entity93 discharged @entity7 -- she says they told her it would be psychologically good for her to get out for a while . when she had serious trouble breathing three days later she tried to get back into the hospital , but @entity93 informed her she 'd used up her supply of @entity105 days and would n't accept her . @entity105 -- the federal insurance program for the elderly and for anyone with disabilities -- would n't pay for another hospitalization until @entity7 had been out of the hospital for sixty days . but @entity7 was too sick to stay out of the hospital for six days , much less sixty . so @entity7 relied on @entity112 , public insurance that was supplied by her home state of @entity54 . she was admitted to the @entity115 , where she was cared for by @entity116 , her beloved pulmonologist . but then , another hurdle . @entity31 explained that most lung transplant centers , including the two in @entity54 , do n't do transplants on patients with @entity42 , referring them to larger centers like @entity93 that have more experience with such complicated cases . @entity7 and @entity8 , now 24 and 23 , were desperate . her doctors predicted she would n't live a year without new lungs . going on her husband 's private insurance was n't an option , since @entity8 is on his father 's policy . in february , @entity31 wrote a letter to @entity112 , pleading with them to make an exception and pay for @entity7 's care at @entity93 , even though it was out of state . @entity112 denied his plea , and that 's when the squabbling began . in a statement to @entity0 , a spokeswoman for the @entity143 pointed the finger at @entity93 , saying the medical center had declined to enroll as a @entity112 provider . " @entity112 policies allow for a simplified enrollment process for out - of - state providers in such situations , " wrote the spokeswoman , @entity148 . " @entity93 reverse its decision and choose to enroll as a @entity112 provider , the @entity153 ... will be happy to expedite their application . " @entity93 counters that @entity112 told them that if they want to care for @entity7 , they would have to sign up hundreds of their doctors to accept @entity112 patients . while @entity93 spokeswoman @entity160 did n't elaborate , a hospital might be loathe to sign up for large - scale coverage of out - of - state @entity112 patients as payments under such programs are typically very low . asking for hundreds of doctors to sign up to take @entity112 is " an unusually restrictive approach and contrary to single - case agreements that we have signed with other state medicaid programs , " @entity160 wrote . " @entity93 wants to help @entity7 , and our physicians and staff have done everything possible to make that happen ... it is up to @entity112 to address this situation . " today , @entity7 waits in limbo in her hospital bed , hoping that the three parties -- @entity105 , @entity112 , and @entity93 -- will work things out so she can get her new lungs . " i feel like they 're putting a dollar sign on my life , " she says . " i do n't want to die because of money . that 's stupid . nobody should have to do that . " if @entity7 does n't get her transplant , not only will she die , but she 'll never be near her husband again because of the risk that she could give him her infection , which could be deadly for him as he 's on drugs to suppress his immune system . as a result of inquiries from @entity0 , on wednesday @entity198 , the director of the media relations group at the @entity200 arranged for a caseworker to call @entity7 at the hospital . but it did n't go very well . @entity7 says the caller , who identified herself as @entity205 , was " rude , mean , and angry . " " she said someone had told her to call me , and she acted like it was just a pain to have to be talking to me , " she says . @entity7 says the @entity105 representative told her she would look into her situation . in a statement , @entity211 with @entity200 wrote to @entity0 : " we are working quickly to fully understand this difficult and complex situation so that this patient can get the care she needs . @entity200 is reaching out to the state agency to find a solution as soon as possible . " caught in the middle between the hospital and insurance , @entity7 tries to stay strong , just as she advised her husband to do nearly six years ago in their first @entity1 conversation . skyping with @entity8 helps , and raising money on their @entity1 page keeps her mind busy . and she 's always thinking about their " after transplant bucket list , " which they keep in a safe in their house so it wo n't be destroyed by fire or flood . on the list : drive through every state . learn another language and visit a country where they speak it . write a book together about their love story . they have simpler dreams as well . like going grocery shopping together , or sitting side by side on the couch to watch television . and this is their biggest goal : " i just want to make it to see our four year anniversary in july and be able to hold hands and just hug . that 's all i really want -- to be able to hug my husband on our fourth anniversary , " she says . wednesday afternoon , there were signs of hope . @entity261 , the @entity93 spokeswoman , sent an email to @entity0 . " @entity263 has reached out to us to talk . so stay tuned , " she wrote . @entity7 and @entity8 were glad to hear it . " i do n't care what i have to do to get her lungs , " @entity8 said . " i will just keep trying until there 's nothing left to try . "

( @entity0 ) late one night on @entity1 , a girl with cystic fibrosis messaged a boy with cystic fibrosis , and both their lives were changed forever*****1
the girl , @entity7 , read that the boy , @entity8 , was very sick*****1
" if you ever need a friend to talk to , you can reach out to me , " she wrote*****0
" sorry , but do i know you ? " he responded*****0
no , you do n't , @entity7 wrote back , and told @entity8 a bit about herself*****1
like him , she was 18 , and " my breathing is pretty crappy and i see you are in the hospital*****0
i 'm sorry*****0
i know it sucks ! ... but you just got ta stay strong*****0
" messages between the two flew back and forth*****0
they realized they were falling in love*****0
for most other couples , the next step would be to meet in person*****0
but for @entity7 and @entity8 , that was complicated -- and dangerous*****1
cystic fibrosis patients should n't be near each other because they can share infections that could cripple their already fragile lungs*****1
dr. @entity31 at the @entity32 , @entity7 's pulmonologist since she was a little girl , had lectured her many times that face - to - face meetings with other @entity37 patients were a bad idea*****1
in their online conversations , one of the first things @entity8 told @entity7 about himself was that he had @entity42 , a horribly dangerous infection for people with @entity37 " i was like , ' hi , i 'm @entity8 from @entity44 and i have @entity42 , ' because it 's such a big deal in the @entity37 community , " he remembers*****1
" i left the decision about whether we should meet up completely up to her*****0
" @entity7 listened to her heart , even if it might hurt her lungs*****0
she asked @entity8 to come visit her in @entity53 , @entity54*****0
" i told @entity8 i 'd rather be happy -- like really , really happy -- for five years of my life and die sooner than be mediocre happy and live for twenty years , " @entity7 says*****1
" that was definitely something i had to think about , but when you have those feelings , you just know*****0
" so on august 28 , 2009 , @entity8 drove more than six hours from @entity60 , @entity44 , to @entity7 's hometown in @entity53 , @entity54 , where they 'd arranged to meet at the @entity63*****1
at 7:10 pm -- they remember the time precisely -- @entity7 got out of her car and saw @entity8 leaning against a brick wall looking cool and handsome in his sunglasses*****1
" my heart was racing , but i just went right up to him and hugged and kissed him on the mouth without even saying hello , " she remembers*****0

later the young couple drove around @entity53 , and @entity8 gave her a necklace for her nineteenth birthday , which was two days before*****0
their health quickly deteriorated , and within months , the new husband and wife went on oxygen full time*****0
too ill to work , @entity8 quit his job at his family 's auto repair shop , and @entity7 quit hers as a store clerk*****1
in august , 2014 , the couple entered the @entity93 together to wait for new lungs*****0
@entity8 's came first , and on november 17 , he had his transplant*****1
despite his @entity42 , which makes transplants more complicated , it was a success*****0
" i was so thrilled*****0
i was so happy for him , " @entity7 says*****0
the month after @entity8 's surgery , @entity93 discharged @entity7 -- she says they told her it would be psychologically good for her to get out for a while*****1
when she had serious trouble breathing three days later she tried to get back into the hospital , but @entity93 informed her she 'd used up her supply of @entity105 days and would n't accept her*****0
@entity105 -- the federal insurance program for the elderly and for anyone with disabilities -- would n't pay for another hospitalization until @entity7 had been out of the hospital for sixty days*****0
but @entity7 was too sick to stay out of the hospital for six days , much less sixty*****0
so @entity7 relied on @entity112 , public insurance that was supplied by her home state of @entity54*****0
she was admitted to the @entity115 , where she was cared for by @entity116 , her beloved pulmonologist*****0
but then , another hurdle*****0
@entity31 explained that most lung transplant centers , including the two in @entity54 , do n't do transplants on patients with @entity42 , referring them to larger centers like @entity93 that have more experience with such complicated cases*****1
@entity7 and @entity8 , now 24 and 23 , were desperate*****1
her doctors predicted she would n't live a year without new lungs*****0
going on her husband 's private insurance was n't an option , since @entity8 is on his father 's policy*****0
in february , @entity31 wrote a letter to @entity112 , pleading with them to make an exception and pay for @entity7 's care at @entity93 , even though it was out of state*****0
@entity112 denied his plea , and that 's when the squabbling began*****0
in a statement to @entity0 , a spokeswoman for the @entity143 pointed the finger at @entity93 , saying the medical center had declined to enroll as a @entity112 provider*****0

" i feel like they 're putting a dollar sign on my life , " she says*****0
" i do n't want to die because of money*****0
that 's stupid*****0
nobody should have to do that*****0
" if @entity7 does n't get her transplant , not only will she die , but she 'll never be near her husband again because of the risk that she could give him her infection , which could be deadly for him as he 's on drugs to suppress his immune system*****1

skyping with @entity8 helps , and raising money on their @entity1 page keeps her mind busy*****0
and she 's always thinking about their " after transplant bucket list , " which they keep in a safe in their house so it wo n't be destroyed by fire or flood*****0
on the list : drive through every state*****0
learn another language and visit a country where they speak it*****0
write a book together about their love story*****0
they have simpler dreams as well*****0
like going grocery shopping together , or sitting side by side on the couch to watch television*****0
and this is their biggest goal : " i just want to make it to see our four year anniversary in july and be able to hold hands and just hug*****0
that 's all i really want -- to be able to hug my husband on our fourth anniversary , " she says*****0
wednesday afternoon , there were signs of hope*****0
