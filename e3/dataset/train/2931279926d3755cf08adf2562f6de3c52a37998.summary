@entity2 ( @entity3 ) now the real @entity1 trial can begin*****1
a federal jury 's decision to convict @entity6 of 30 charges related to the 2013 @entity1 bombings was the most anticlimactic of anticlimaxes*****0
the 21 - year - old 's lawyers admitted from the beginning that their client had participated in the horrific terrorist attack , which both scarred and strengthened this city*****0
the outcome of this first phase may have been preordained , but nearly two years after the bombing , the trial has held @entity2 and the region in thrall — more so than i might have imagined*****0
the case regularly lands on the front pages of our two daily newspapers , the @entity24 and the @entity26 , and often leads the local television newscasts*****0
the @entity29 feeds of reporters covering the trial are avidly followed*****0
we have n't learned much new , although harrowing details about the deaths of the @entity6 brothers ' four victims have come out*****1
more than anything , many people find something cathartic in seeing the seemingly insolent , unrepentant @entity6 being brought to justice*****1
the only issue to be decided is whether @entity6 should be executed*****0
which is why the second phase of his trial is the one that really matters*****0
was @entity6 so thoroughly under the sway of his radicalized older brother , @entity47 , that he should be spared lethal injection ? or had this seemingly typical teenager transformed himself into a hardened jihadist who obsessed over @entity53 propaganda such as the article " make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom " ? what kind of justice should @entity6 receive ? there is no death penalty in @entity63 , and in september 2013 , according to a @entity24 poll , 57 % of respondents supported life in prison for @entity6 ; just 33 % said he should be executed*****1
by moving the case into federal court , @entity69 attorney general @entity68 made it likely that @entity6 would receive the death penalty*****0
keep in mind that no members of the jury were deemed eligible to serve unless they stated beforehand that they were willing to consider putting @entity6 to death*****0
but imagine a different scenario in which @entity6 had been allowed to plead guilty in return for a life sentence*****1
he would have been denied the public stage he has been granted ; although he has not testified ( so far ) , his terrorist actions have been replayed over and over again for people to see the world over*****0
the 2015 @entity1 will take place in less than two weeks , on monday , april 20*****0
thousands of runners will clog the 26.2 - mile route , and tens of thousands will cheer them on — as they did last year , proving to the world that we will not be intimidated*****0
and @entity6 's lawyers will still be fighting for their client 's life*****0
it is a natural if disturbing reaction to events like this that it 's easier to remember the names of the perpetrators than of their victims*****0
but @entity6 is a loser and a nobody*****0
he should be allowed to fade away into the obscurity of a maximum - security prison cell*****1
the people who deserve to be remembered are those he and his brother killed on @entity107 — @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 — and @entity111 , the @entity113 police officer they executed in cold blood*****1
it is they who should live on in our collective memories .*****0
