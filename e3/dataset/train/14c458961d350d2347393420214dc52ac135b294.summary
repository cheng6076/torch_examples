the federal government estimated 4.2 million barrels of oil spilled into the @entity2 , but @entity18 argued in court that it was much lower*****1
a judge ruled @entity18 was responsible for the release of 3.1 million barrels*****0
imagining @entity23 : a rig worker 's daughter and her dreams there were dire predictions of what would follow*****1
environmentalists and others braced for an environmental collapse on a massive scale*****0
scientists continue to study environmental impacts , but five years after the spill , the long - term negative effects remain unclear and are , in many cases , highly disputed*****1

most long - term scientific studies on environmental disasters take longer than the five years that have passed*****1
studies so far have shown a variety of negative impacts on wildlife immediately after the spill , but others show some of those species are bouncing back*****0
fish landings in the @entity2 , the amount of fish caught by the fishing industry , have returned*****0
oysters are also recovering in many areas*****0
and according to the @entity108 , tests on edible seafood show no excess hydrocarbons in the region 's food supply*****0
the spill 's effects on other species are less clear*****0
dolphins are dying at an accelerated rate along the @entity117 , and even more so in @entity118 where the oil hit the hardest*****0
but the dolphin " mortality event , " as the government calls it , began months before the spill*****0
studies suggest the diseases dolphins suffer from in places like @entity127 , @entity118 , could be caused by oil exposure , but direct links to the 2010 @entity79 spill have not been proven*****1
seaside sparrows in the @entity2 are also showing signs of strain , and some studies cite oil as contributing to reductions in their overall abundance*****0
while aerial surveys taken in 2010 suggest tens of thousands of sea turtles were exposed to oil in coastal waters , government agencies are still gathering data and have not concluded if the spill will have long - term effects on sea turtle populations*****1
but perhaps the greatest unknown is what , if anything , millions of gallons of oil on the deep seafloor are doing to the overall environment of the @entity2 itself*****1
oceanographers have been tracking the residue from the @entity79 as it has settled on the bottom of the ocean*****0
@entity158 , an oceanographer with the @entity159 , has used underwater robots to capture soil samples and run tests to determine just how far the oil has traveled*****0
her research and other studies show @entity18 's oil is scattered in patches across more than 1,200 square miles of the seafloor*****1
