( @entity2 ) @entity1 's @entity0 this week found herself in the news , rather than reporting on it , after a video surfaced showing her berating and belittling an employee of a tow company in @entity9 , @entity10 . among the highlights , as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to @entity13 : " i 'm on television and you 're in a f * * king trailer , honey , " and " i would n't work at a scumbag place like this . makes my skin crawl even being here . " and , finally , " lose some weight , baby girl . " it 's pretty cringe - worthy stuff that seems difficult , if not impossible , to defend . @entity25 quickly issued an apology , blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility . it was , however , too late : the # firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on @entity35 , where she was called everything from classist , class-less , and " ugly on the inside " to a " sad , self - hating coward . " @entity1 , meanwhile , announced that @entity25 would be suspended for a week . certainly @entity25 should have known better than to have used such words , even if that 's what she was thinking , least of all because in our @entity42 age , such missteps always come to light . but while @entity25 's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement , evidence of a mean girl who never left high school , what 's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on @entity25 without fully knowing -- or , it seems , caring about -- the other side of the story . the video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only @entity25 's responses , not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on . @entity25 knew she was being taped ; at one point , she looks directly at the camera . the employee even threatens to make the video public . did @entity25 keep going because she has that much of a self - destructive streak ? or because she truly could not help herself ? or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this particular game ? how @entity0 could have responded these days , there 's nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace , whether it 's @entity82 or @entity83 or @entity0 , who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing : that the over-privileged and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial . the high price of public shaming online sure , @entity25 probably feels entitled , but that 's our doing , too . we 're a society obsessed with putting celebrities on a pedestal -- celebrating them , compensating them . and yet when , in a moment of frustration and stress , @entity25 lets the entitlement bestowed on her win out over taking a deep breath and walking away , we 're right there to demand to know what gives her the nerve . you know what gives her the nerve ? we do . ( be honest : when is the last time you had a warm and fuzzy experience at the tow lot ? ) but we 're really no better than she is . the problem with social media , and our dependence on it , is that it allows people to present and receive whatever angle they want , biased or not , fair or not . it 's the " power of the press " without the objectivity or accountability demanded of the actual press . and it has enabled a dangerous vigilantism that makes those who use that power no different from the ones they are supposedly rallying against . think about it . who was worse : @entity25 or the people who made that video public , and who did so without owning up to their part in the conversation ? who is worse : @entity0 for childishly mocking a confrontational tow employee 's bad teeth , or the @entity35 masses who call for justice and " the return of class " -- who express views like , " part of me feels bad for @entity0 . poor thing actually believes she was hired for ' brains ' and ' education ' ? should n't they question whether , in fact , @entity25 could have actually been standing up for herself ? sorry to break it to you , but these days , we 're all bullies . at least @entity0 owns up to it .

among the highlights , as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to @entity13 : " i 'm on television and you 're in a fucking trailer , honey , " and " i would n't work at a scumbag place like this*****0
makes my skin crawl even being here*****0
" and , finally , " lose some weight , baby girl*****0
" it 's pretty cringe - worthy stuff that seems difficult , if not impossible , to defend*****0
@entity25 quickly issued an apology , blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility*****0
it was , however , too late : the # firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on @entity35 , where she was called everything from classist , class-less , and " ugly on the inside " to a " sad , self - hating coward*****0
" @entity1 , meanwhile , announced that @entity25 would be suspended for a week*****0
certainly @entity25 should have known better than to have used such words , even if that 's what she was thinking , least of all because in our @entity42 age , such missteps always come to light*****0
but while @entity25 's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement , evidence of a mean girl who never left high school , what 's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on @entity25 without fully knowing -- or , it seems , caring about -- the other side of the story*****0
the video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only @entity25 's responses , not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on*****1
@entity25 knew she was being taped ; at one point , she looks directly at the camera*****0
the employee even threatens to make the video public*****0
did @entity25 keep going because she has that much of a self - destructive streak ? or because she truly could not help herself ? or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this particular game ? how @entity0 could have responded these days , there 's nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace , whether it 's @entity82 or @entity83 or @entity0 , who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing : that the over-privileged and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial*****1
the high price of public shaming online sure , @entity25 probably feels entitled , but that 's our doing , too*****0
we 're a society obsessed with putting celebrities on a pedestal -- celebrating them , compensating them*****0
and yet when , in a moment of frustration and stress , @entity25 lets the entitlement bestowed on her win out over taking a deep breath and walking away , we 're right there to demand to know what gives her the nerve*****0
you know what gives her the nerve ? we do*****0
( be honest : when is the last time you had a warm and fuzzy experience at the tow lot ? ) but we 're really no better than she is*****0
the problem with social media , and our dependence on it , is that it allows people to present and receive whatever angle they want , biased or not , fair or not*****0
it 's the " power of the press " without the objectivity or accountability demanded of the actual press*****0
and it has enabled a dangerous vigilantism that makes those who use that power no different from the ones they are supposedly rallying against*****0
think about it*****0
who was worse : @entity25 or the people who made that video public , and who did so without owning up to their part in the conversation ? who is worse : @entity0 for childishly mocking a confrontational tow employee 's bad teeth , or the @entity35 masses who call for justice and " the return of class " -- who express views like , " part of me feels bad for @entity0*****1
poor thing actually believes she was hired for ' brains ' and ' education ' ? should n't they question whether , in fact , @entity25 could have actually been standing up for herself ? sorry to break it to you , but these days , we 're all bullies*****0
at least @entity0 owns up to it .*****0
