( @entity1 ) i remember the day i stopped praying . it was the day after my little brother , @entity3 , died of cancer . he was 25 . i was so angry at @entity5 . i was 27 at the time , and , like most young people i had stopped going to church . but , on that day -- that terrible day -- i desperately needed to understand why @entity5 took my brother . i called the nearest catholic church , looking for a priest . a lady picked up the phone . " can i talk with @entity13 ? " i asked . i wish i could say her answer was " yes . " instead , she asked me if i was a member of that particular parish . " does it matter ? " i asked . ( at the time i lived far from my home parish . ) i do n't remember how she responded , but the answer about my being able to see @entity13 was clearly no. i do n't know if all @entity25 churches would have shut me out , but i figured , at the time , it was part of the long list of rules the @entity30 required @entity25 leaders to follow . i cried for a bit , then decided i would never ask @entity5 for anything . clearly , his conduits on @entity35 did not have time for me -- a lifelong @entity25 -- and sinner -- so why would he ? ever since , i 've considered myself a lapsed @entity25 . until @entity38 . there is something about @entity38 that 's reawakened my faith . and it 's not because he opened the floodgates to allow sin in the eyes of the church . he still argues against things i passionately support , but i find myself -- like many other lapsed @entity49 -- enthralled . recently i had the pleasure of meeting one of the @entity38 's newly appointed cardinals . his name is cardinal @entity54 . the 57 - year - old presides at the @entity56 of @entity57 in @entity58 . one of my first questions : what is it about @entity38 ? " every person is a mystery you know . ... but what 's evident is this man is living with such freedom , such inner freedom . he 's himself . he 's in tune with the @entity69 , " @entity54 told me . " those close to him say he 's up close to 4 in the morning to prepare his daily @entity72 , which is at 7 in the morning on the weekdays . so that 's almost three hours of prayer , preparation and silence before the @entity69 and the word of @entity5 . wow , that really fine - tunes you to start off a day . " perhaps that 's how the @entity38 stays humble . why he defies tradition and washes the feet of the disabled , women and those of other faiths . why he ordered showers to be built for the poor in @entity88 . all of this is appealing , but it 's more than that . in my mind , it 's his tone . when pope @entity38 said , " if a person is gay and he searches for the @entity69 and has good will , who am i to judge ? " the comment took me aback . homosexuality has long been a taboo subject for the @entity30 , yet pope @entity38 uttered those welcoming words . @entity54 likened the @entity38 's approach to @entity102 . " @entity102 did n't judge . @entity102 did not come as a judge . he came as someone who preached and talked about the love of @entity5 . " those kinds of answers are so different in my experience , but i understand why more conservative @entity49 worry . if the @entity38 does not judge , then who will tell us who is a sinner and who is not ? " i hear that sometimes , too , " @entity54 told me . " i think @entity38 is conservative in the right way . you have to be conservative enough to come back to what is the foundation : that 's the @entity118 . you can not reproach @entity38 of not living the @entity118 , or not preaching the truth of the @entity118 . " but is n't homosexuality a sin in the eyes of the church ? " there is room for everyone . the door is open , " @entity127 insisted . " of course you know that the @entity49 will never promote same sex marriage , but do we respect homosexual persons ? do we welcome them ? do we accompany them ? of course . but to respect the @entity49 and its teaching , which is based on a long tradition and also the word of @entity5 , we will not go so far as to bless . but that does n't mean we reject . " that last sentiment -- " that does n't mean we reject . " -- did it for me . i finally understood why @entity38 reawakened my faith . i always felt my church would reject me for committing the smallest of sins . like calling a priest at a church that was not my home parish . like not covering my head with a traditional veil at @entity152 . like accidentally eating meat on holy friday . like supporting the use of contraception . but as @entity54 told me , @entity102 walked with sinners until the very end . he did not banish them to fires of hell , for he refused to give up on anyone . the @entity163 's last words to me : " i 'm trying to do my best on ( the ) local level -- to have an open ear to what the church and world are experiencing . to see how we can today respond to those needs . i want people to see me , and the church , as an open heart to grow together . not a church that 's imposing -- we have nothing to impose -- we have someone to propose : the lord @entity102 and his @entity118 . " i ca n't wait to go church next sunday . and , yes , i will bow my head and pray for forgiveness , and if i 'm worthy , @entity102 's love .

( @entity1 ) i remember the day i stopped praying*****0
it was the day after my little brother , @entity3 , died of cancer*****0
he was 25*****0
i was so angry at @entity5*****0
i was 27 at the time , and , like most young people i had stopped going to church*****0
but , on that day -- that terrible day -- i desperately needed to understand why @entity5 took my brother*****0
i called the nearest catholic church , looking for a priest*****0

i wish i could say her answer was " yes*****0
" instead , she asked me if i was a member of that particular parish*****0
" does it matter ? " i asked*****0

i cried for a bit , then decided i would never ask @entity5 for anything*****0
clearly , his conduits on @entity35 did not have time for me -- a lifelong @entity25 -- and sinner -- so why would he ? ever since , i 've considered myself a lapsed @entity25*****0
until @entity38*****0
there is something about @entity38 that 's reawakened my faith*****1
and it 's not because he opened the floodgates to allow sin in the eyes of the church*****0
he still argues against things i passionately support , but i find myself -- like many other lapsed @entity49 -- enthralled*****0
recently i had the pleasure of meeting one of the @entity38 's newly appointed cardinals*****1
his name is cardinal @entity54*****0
the 57 - year - old presides at the @entity56 of @entity57 in @entity58*****0
one of my first questions : what is it about @entity38 ? " every person is a mystery you know*****0
... but what 's evident is this man is living with such freedom , such inner freedom*****0

i always felt my church would reject me for committing the smallest of sins*****0
like calling a priest at a church that was not my home parish*****0
like not covering my head with a traditional veil at @entity152*****0
like accidentally eating meat on holy friday*****0
like supporting the use of contraception*****0
but as @entity54 told me , @entity102 walked with sinners until the very end*****0
he did not banish them to fires of hell , for he refused to give up on anyone*****0
the @entity163 's last words to me : " i 'm trying to do my best on ( the ) local level -- to have an open ear to what the church and world are experiencing*****0
to see how we can today respond to those needs*****0
i want people to see me , and the church , as an open heart to grow together*****0
not a church that 's imposing -- we have nothing to impose -- we have someone to propose : the lord @entity102 and his @entity118*****0
