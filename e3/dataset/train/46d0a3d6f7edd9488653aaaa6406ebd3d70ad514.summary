( @entity2 ) @entity1 's ex-fiance is speaking out about their dispute over frozen embryos created while they dated . in an op - ed published by @entity7 on wednesday , @entity5 explained his rationale for fighting to keep the two female embryos he shares with the actress . " i wanted to keep this private , but recently the story broke to the world , " @entity5 wrote . " it has gotten attention not only because of the people involved -- my ex is @entity1 , who stars in the @entity19 series " @entity20 " -- but also because embryonic custody disputes raise important questions about life , religion and parenthood . " @entity5 says he met the actress in 2010 and they got engaged two years later , at which point they decided to create the embryos and conceive a child via a surrogate . after two attempts failed to bring fertilized embryos to term , they created two more embryos using her eggs and his sperm . " when we create embryos for the purpose of life , should we not define them as life , rather than as property ? , " he said . " ... a woman is entitled to bring a pregnancy to term even if the man objects . should n't a man who is willing to take on all parental responsibilities be similarly entitled to bring his embryos to term even if the woman objects ? " @entity5 said he filed a complaint against the 42 - year - old actress to prevent her from destroying their two embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization . he filed it in august in @entity61 , @entity62 , where they apparently lived while they dated . " we signed a form stating that any embryos created through the process could be brought to term only with both parties ' consent . the form did not specify -- as @entity62 law requires -- what would happen if we separated , " he said . " i am asking to have it voided . " representatives for @entity1 have declined to comment in the past . @entity5 has said he believes " life begins at fertilization " and wants to implant the embryos in a surrogate and bring them to term . he said he does n't want any money from the egg donor . the case has led to questions about who has the right to embryos . typically , a prior legal agreement between a couple spells out who has ultimate authority , said fertility specialist dr. @entity94 , who 's not involved in this case . " usually when embryos are created , whether the couple is married or just consenting adults , there 's usually a power of attorney that is described to these embryos , if they are frozen for future use , " he said . in most cases , the mother or the origin of the egg is given power of attorney , although anyone can make a request , @entity94 said . if there 's a disagreement , the courts usually get involved to decide who legally owns the embryos , he said . @entity1 is now reportedly engaged to actor @entity115 .
