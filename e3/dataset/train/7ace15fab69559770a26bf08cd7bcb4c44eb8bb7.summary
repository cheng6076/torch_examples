a @entity7 maglev train hit 603 kilometers per hour ( 374 miles per hour ) on an experimental track in @entity9 tuesday , setting a decisive new world record*****1
a spokesperson said the train spent 10.8 seconds traveling above 600 kilometers per hour , during which it covered 1.8 kilometers ( 1.1 miles )*****1

that beat the old record of 581 kilometers per hour ( 361 miles per hour ) , which was set in 2003 during another @entity5 maglev test*****1
right now , @entity40 operates the world 's fastest commercial maglev , which has hit 431 kilometers per hour ( 268 miles per hour ) on a route through @entity44*****1
by contrast , the fastest train in the @entity46 , @entity48 's @entity47 , is only capable of 241 kilometers per hour ( 150 miles per hour ) , though it usually plods along at half that speed*****1
unlike traditional trains , maglev trains work by using magnets to push the train away from the tracks and drive the train forward*****1
@entity5 's maglevs do n't use metal tracks — instead , they float nearly 10 cm ( 4 inches ) above special guideways , allowing for frictionless movement*****0
@entity7 has been testing their train to figure out the best operational speed for a planned route between @entity1 and @entity64 , scheduled to begin service in 2027*****1
that trip can take nearly 5 hours by car*****0
but in the future , a maglev train could finish the journey in 40 minutes*****1
