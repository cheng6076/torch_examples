( @entity0 ) tuesday is @entity1 , the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women 's groups as the point in the year women would have to work to make up for " lost " wages as a result of the so - called wage gap*****1
in the wake of @entity12 's presidential announcement , the " holiday " has special meaning*****0
@entity21 's election will no doubt center on women voters , and the @entity19 women 's agenda centers on pay equity and fairness in the workplace*****0
here 's the thing : that 77 - cent wage gap statistic is grossly overstated*****1
it 's a comparison of averages -- comparing full - time working women with full - time working men -- that does n't control for any of the important factors that go into determining one 's salary such as education , profession , title , time spent in the workforce and time spent in the office each day , to name a few*****1
when we do control for these variables , a much smaller wage gap persists of about 4 - 6 cents , some of which may be the result of gender discrimination , but also is likely a function of women 's choices and different behavior , such as not negotiating as often as men do -- factors for which economists simply ca n't control*****1
the new women warriors : reviving the fight for equal rights i frequently reference my own experience as a working mom with young children as an example of someone who not only made the " mistake " of majoring in history but then pursued a career in the nonprofit political world -- not exactly a winning combination if a high salary is the ultimate goal*****0
add to this the fact that i took time out of the workplace and worked part time to have a family , and my earning potential simply is n't as high as some of my male counterparts*****0
opinion : why @entity12 should take a pay cut still , conservatives -- and by extension republicans -- ought to be paying attention to @entity1*****0
because for many on the right the midterm election victories signaled that the " war on women " narrative was over*****0
that @entity19 had overplayed their hand and that candidates such as @entity94 's @entity93 simply could n't succeed*****0
in some respects , @entity95 are right*****0
voters did choose policy substance over gendered rhetoric , and in many ways they rejected the insidious " war on women " narrative*****0
the facts about the gender wage gap but women voters are valuable , and @entity1 ought to be a reminder that @entity19 are n't ready to surrender*****1
let 's remember a 5 - point national gender gap still remains in the @entity19 ' favor*****0
bottom line : the " war on women " narrative has n't been turned off -- it 's simply shifted gears*****0
and with the presidential election season just revving up , we can expect to see the " war on women " focus turn to the workplace , where @entity19 will claim women are paid unfairly , not given the paid leave benefits they deserve and not given the child care support they demand*****0
many on the right fear if they try to push back on the issue of pay equity they will be skewered in the polls*****0
but nothing could be further from the truth*****0
map : where the gender pay gap is the widest the @entity138 conducted a randomized , controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap , and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the @entity145 -- a legislative " solution " to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for @entity19*****1
in short , if the right is silent on the issue , the left has the potential to win the battle but not the war*****0
it 's tempting on days such as @entity1 for @entity95 to want to lie low -- to ignore the rhetoric and hope it will all go away by wednesday*****0
but the reality is that 's the worst thing conservatives can do*****0
the public is open to hearing the real story on pay equity , and conservatives need to be ready and willing to respond .*****0
