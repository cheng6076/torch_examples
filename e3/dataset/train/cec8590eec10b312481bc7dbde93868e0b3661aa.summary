( @entity1 ) i usually think of april as tax month , but it seems to be morphing into @entity3*****0
@entity5 owner @entity4 advised @entity6 to have their blood tested for everything available -- and to do so every three months*****1
following her mother 's cancer diagnosis , singer @entity9 urged her fans to remind their parents to get screening tests*****0
and @entity16 gov. @entity15 signed legislation to allow @entity18 to get any lab test without a doctor 's order*****0
freedom of information -- always sounds like a good thing*****0
but there are many lab tests to order on yourself : @entity28 's @entity27 lists over a thousand*****0
they are not all blood tests , but a lot of them are*****1
and since blood tests require blood , you would surely develop at least one medical problem if you actually followed mr. @entity4 's advice to get them all : anemia*****1
a frothy private sector is gearing up to serve the " test me " market*****0
in those states that allow it -- and over half do -- laboratories are offering walk - in and online services to individuals who want to check their own lab values*****0
( and if you want to get in on the ground floor of this business , check out the franchise opportunities at @entity54 , @entity55 , and all @entity56*****0
) some might argue that this freedom to test is the path to a healthier society*****0
but the primary effect wo n't be more health , but rather more medical care*****1
fundamentally well people will appear in doctors ' offices with " abnormal " results*****0
abnormalities are common in normal people , as we learned when @entity71 - body ct scanning was in vogue a decade ago ( thankfully , only briefly )*****0
so doctors will increasingly face one of two options : take the time to reassure these new patients that their results are n't really that abnormal or chase down abnormal results with more testing*****0
further testing will often make clear that the initial results were false alarms*****0
or it will confirm the presence of abnormality -- most of which will be minor abnormalities*****0
often it wo n't be clear what to do , but doctors will be pressed to do something*****1
that 's when the real problems begin*****0
will anybody be helped ? maybe*****0
will anybody be hurt ? definitely*****0
the disturbing truth is that it is hard for us to make well people feel better*****1
but it 's not that hard for us to make them feel worse*****0
decades of research have shown that there are real side - effects to testing the well : more anxiety ( that ca n't be good for your health ) , more procedures ( which often involve needles , pain and can even lead to complications like collapsed lungs ) and more treatment for " disease " not destined to cause problems ( as in over a million additional @entity116 men treated for prostate cancer , ditto women for breast cancer )*****1
to see how far wrong testing can go , check out @entity121 : where ultrasound screening has increased the amount of thyroid cancer -- and thyroid cancer surgery -- by 15-fold*****0
i can tell you one thing for sure , the freedom to test wo n't save money*****1
sure , a competitive market will drive down prices for individual tests*****0
but advertising will drive up the volume of testing*****0
and then there are all the office visits and subsequent testing for the abnormal results*****0
this will cost people real money -- either in terms of higher insurance premiums or higher out - of - pocket costs*****0
maybe this kind of freedom of information is n't such a good thing*****0
of course , there have been genuine advances in diagnostic testing*****0
diagnostic tests can be extremely useful in sorting out acute medical problems*****0
but if you feel well , do n't think that testing will make you feel better*****1
the biotech sector is excited about testing well people -- it 's a huge market -- and is developing lots of new product*****0
now you can sequence your dna , soon you will be able to monitor your immune system 's signature*****0
now you can monitor your vital signs on your smartwatch , soon you will be able to test your breath for lung cancer on a phone app. they are even implanting thermodynamic sensors in a bra to test for breast cancer*****0
a breast cancer monitoring bra -- i ca n't make this stuff up*****1
should we outlaw an individual 's freedom to test ? no. we do n't need another victimless crime*****0
but it is certainly an area that demands regulation*****0
the @entity186 has a longstanding mandate to protect us from snake oil treatments*****0
now it needs to start worrying about snake oil testing*****0
it 's also an area that demands education*****0
the public needs to know that while medical data can be very useful , that does n't mean they are routinely useful*****0
abnormalities in sick patients mean something different than the same abnormalities in well people*****0
it is easier to collect data than it is to know what the data mean -- much less what to do about the results*****0
@entity208 is a good thing*****0
but feel free not to exercise your freedoms*****0
just as carrying a gun does n't necessarily make you any safer , testing yourself does n't necessarily make you any healthier .*****1
