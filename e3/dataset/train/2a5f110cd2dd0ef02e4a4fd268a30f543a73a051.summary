@entity1 , @entity2 ( @entity3 ) it did n't look like much , but we 'd been told it was typical of the kind of craft ferrying the route between @entity9 and @entity1*****1
better , everyone advised , to be low key , even if low key meant faded lights and three water pumps chugging at all times*****0
the wooden vessel was called @entity17 — after the holy city*****0
we were told we 'd be at the port in @entity1 by the next morning , but as the hours ticked by it soon became apparent that that was wildly optimistic*****0
@entity22 came and we were still only halfway there*****0
we 'd been given a secure route , charted for us by the @entity25*****0
it meant hugging the coastline , trying to stay as much as possible out of the deeper water in the middle of the @entity30 where the world 's navies seemed to be squaring off*****0
it was almost double the distance of the direct route*****0
add to that a strong current -- and stomach - churning seas -- and it felt like we would spend an eternity on board*****0
after our second sunset , we were finally close enough for my phone to ping with a @entity2 welcome message*****0
however , we could n't risk arriving at night ; even getting too close to shore would risk being mistaken for a re-supply vessel and potentially taking a @entity47 hit*****0
the captain slowed the boat to a crawl so the remaining miles would stretch until daybreak*****0
finally , morning came*****0
it was time to go into town to see what life was like for the people of @entity1*****0
we were n't really sure what to expect but we did know we could n't stay for long*****0
from the moment we stepped through the gates of the port , we were met by noise and desperation , shoving and shouting*****0
" where are you going ? " " i 'll pay , i 'll pay " " are you here to take the @entity65 ? " i shouted back that we 'd return soon*****0
we had just five hours on the ground and we needed to visit the hospital , the shuttered markets , the frontlines*****0
there was so much we needed to see*****0
the crowds clustered around our camera lens , asking " why ? " " why is this happening ? " " why has n't it stopped ? " it felt like no time had passed before we were told we had to go*****0
the shelling had begun*****0
we 'd been hearing pops of sniper fire all day but now we could hear rounds of automatic weapons and they were getting louder*****0
as we arrived back at port , we found we were n't leaving alone*****0
after waiting at port , praying a passing ship would dock , ours had become an unexpected lifeline for some of the families caught in the fighting*****0
the @entity90 asked if we could take 60 refugees*****1
it did n't feel like the answer could be anything but yes*****0
what we did n't realize until it was too late was that the refugees were being charged $ 300 a person : an " exit fee*****0
" those who did n't have the money were pushed back behind the wrought iron gates of the port*****0
those that did shared our day - and - a - half trip home*****0
as the shores of @entity9 grew closer , you could see the uncertainty begin to take over*****0
many of them had come from comfortable lives , before the war shattered them*****0
they had left homes that once hummed with air conditioners and televisions*****0
would the camps have @entity120 , they asked*****0
no , they would n't , i said*****0
what i did n't say was that they 'd be lucky to have electricity*****0
but woven amid the uncertainty was the relief of escape*****0
some of the refugees took over our ship 's galley -- the kitchen*****1
they 'd found a former chef amongst their number who commandeered the store cupboard , sending out a pick and mix of heaped trays*****0
we got tuna spaghetti and more @entity145 coffee than our cameraman @entity146 could possibly drink*****0
because we 'd brought refugees back with us , we were asked by the @entity148 to dock in the country 's north , in @entity151 , so they could be given the proper status while they wait to see what happens back home*****1
the immigration officials were -- understandably -- a little bemused by our presence amongst a boatload of people fleeing @entity2 , but to their credit they decided the important thing was that these families were now safe*****0
from there @entity162 was just a few hours away , hours that stretched into infinity for the families ringing my phone to check that their loved ones had made it into harbor*****0
over the last few hours , people had shyly come up to ask if they could borrow our phone to tell their families they were safe*****0
now a deluge of anxious parents , siblings and partners flooded my ear , asking how it could possibly be that we were n't yet on dry land*****0
but eventually we were , and as we watched the @entity183 officials unload what remained of people 's belongings onto shore , it was a reminder that these were the lucky ones*****1
thousands more are still waiting back in @entity2 , hoping they too will reach a safe port .*****0
