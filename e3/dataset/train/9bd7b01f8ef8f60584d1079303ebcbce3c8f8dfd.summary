" " @entity33 was the light of my life . she was extremely smart , hardworking , beautiful , every father 's dream . i miss her a lot , " said @entity38 , dabbing at his eyes as he described his daughter , a 29 - year - old restaurant manager who was killed in the first blast at the 2013 @entity20 . she was the one who could round up the family and put on big celebrations , he said . " nobody fills that boot now . " others are expected to come and cry for @entity49 , " a jolly soul , " assistant u.s. attorney @entity47 said , quoting the slain @entity53 grad student 's father . more tears will be shed for @entity55 , who was 8 and looked just like his dad . and for @entity57 , who was remembered at his memorial service by these words : " @entity61 heart , big smiles , big service . all love . " " @entity1 murdered each one of them in a way that they had time to feel pain , they had time to be scared and frightened , but they had no time to say good - bye , " @entity47 told the jury .
