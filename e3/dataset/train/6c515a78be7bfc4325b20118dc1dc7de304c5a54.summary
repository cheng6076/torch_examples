( @entity0 ) we did it again , in another @entity3 city*****0
we set @entity4 on fire this time*****1
we brutalized black bodies*****0
we turned a funeral into a riot*****0
we let things get out of hand*****0
we looted*****0
we threw stones at policemen*****0
we threw stones at citizens*****0
we created camera - ready chaos , and we replayed the images*****0
we created a culture of such deep distrust and disrespect that violence seemed the inevitable response*****0
we let the violence flow*****0
we let the violence stand for everything that 's wrong with the things we already did n't like*****0
by now you may be asking , " who 's we ? " you may be saying with some irritation , " do n't lump me in with them*****0
i did n't have anything to do with it*****0
" to which the only real answer can be : stop kidding yourself*****0
the word " we " is one of the great @entity3 words*****0
@entity38*****0
yes we can*****0
we are family*****0
i use " we " a lot when i talk about our country 's achievements*****0
i like to say we won the @entity45 , we put a man on the moon , we invented the @entity48 , we gave the world jazz*****0
well , if @entity52 -- a son of immigrants whose family had nothing to do with any of those accomplishments -- if i get to claim those aspects of @entity3 history , then surely i have to claim the unsavory aspects too*****0
" we " cuts both ways*****0
we enslaved @entity59*****0
we cut reconstruction short and made a mockery of equal citizenship*****0
we supported @entity63 , then redlined , subordinated , and ghettoized african - americans*****0
we cut blacks out of the @entity66*****0
we created a polity in which racial inequity and economic inequality magnify each other unrelentingly*****0
we tried to put a lid on it with heavy policing and a @entity74*****0
we failed*****0
we are the authors of every page of @entity4 's story*****1
do n't tell me it 's not your responsibility or mine*****0
about how slavery and its legacy are artifacts of a time past*****0
someone else 's problem*****0
no , we own them all*****0
and we all have to face that before we can fix anything in @entity4 or beyond*****0
but there 's another dimension of the story of " we " that matters as well*****0
it 's about progressives and conservatives and their competing stories of how we got here*****1
every time protests and violence break out in response to police brutality , the same depressing pattern breaks out*****0
the event becomes simply a rorschach test for left and right , and each side sees in the rioting confirmation of its prior views*****1
for the left , it 's about the deep structural root causes of the alienation and violence*****0
liberals gravitate on social media to commentaries or reactions that reinforce this frame , like the surprisingly astute comments from the @entity122 executive who spelled out why a long history of racial injustice and economic disenfranchisement made rioting nearly inevitable*****0
conservatives gravitate to their own frames , about a lack of personal responsibility or role models among poor urban blacks , about the failures of @entity135 and @entity137 programs , and about how it all comes back to a president ( who happens to be black ) who has divided us by focusing so much on race*****0
what gets lost in this @entity144 replay of left - right frames is a simple reality that we all have to recognize : both longstanding structural racism and personal irresponsibility are on display this week*****0
both a history of police brutality and a present crisis of street violence*****0
both an inherited , multigenerational lack of opportunity and a dearth of leaders willing to address it*****0
we can not separate out the aspects of the problem that do n't fit our preferred explanation -- not if we are sincere about solving the problem*****0
and until more people can see this , we will not see progress*****0
we ca n't judge looters for their antisocial behavior without judging a color - caste structure and a school - to - prison pipeline that has flushed them away like so much refuse*****0
by the same token , we ca n't keep opining about root causes without also supporting the parents and pastors and neighbors who , in their own small ways , are organizing each other to break the cycle of brokenness*****0
i 'm of the left*****0
but it can not possibly be that only those with whom i disagree are responsible for what is happening in @entity4*****0
it can not possibly be that only my worldview contains all the solutions*****0
whatever our political perspective , we need to open our eyes to what is actually happening in @entity4 and other cities in the @entity3 in the second decade of the 21st century*****0
it is an abomination*****0
we should all be able to say that*****0
it 's time to push each other out of our ideological and identity comfort zones and build unlikely coalitions to create more opportunity*****1
it 's time to act like we are all in charge*****1
because we are*****0
and there is no other " we " waiting in the wings .*****0
